              "  'SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER\\n\\nSpeculation the United States will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of State George Shultz\\' visit later this month to Moscow. Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat markets since officials from the two countries held their customary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow\\'s decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects. Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13. Shultz\\' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to Moscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was preparing an offer. Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S. Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped about the prospects of a subsidy offer. But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer, while not a \"done deal,\" is a live possibility. Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent. Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible, are saying they would not rule one out. Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as to predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks. Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials. Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S. Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month. Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat. Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of U.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans. As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal would appear to be price. Last summer the administration took the controversial step of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices far above world market prices. The administration\\'s decision to set the subsidy level up front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen criticism, grain trade sources said. Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz from saying the Soviets were \"chortling\" because Washington was offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to U.S. housewives. The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives here is that a general warming of relations between the two countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times in the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer. In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively. However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances surrounding the administration\\'s announcement of the wheat subsidy offer last summer. Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and industry leaders were led to believe the White House had decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not only the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries. Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to include only the Soviets. That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

              "  'ICO QUOTAS BEFORE OCTOBER UNLIKELY - DELEGATES\\n\\nThe restoration of coffee export quotas before the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (Oct 1/Sept 30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by International Coffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resume negotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegates told reporters. Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the quota dialogue while Brazil\\'s position remains unchanged, they said. Brazil\\'s refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30 pct share of the ICO\\'s global export quota effectively torpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas before October, the delegates noted. Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today, traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr in early trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said. Producer delegates said that while the possibility of reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in practice the idea had effectively been discarded. The ICO\\'s executive board session here this week has so far barely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating general unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are still remote, producer delegates said. Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored, despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last month\\'s negotiations, they said. \"With Brazil\\'s frost season approaching, who wants to negotiate quotas,\" one leading producer delegate said. Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil\\'s frost season (mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks as insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil\\'s crop. Many producers are more interested in working towards reimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system of quota allocations valid until the International Coffee Agreement expires in 1989, they said. Guatemala has already proposed the \"other oilds\" producer group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how to allocate quota shares. Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota distribution system, with some producer delegates reporting growing support for a radical reallocation, based on the principle of \"objective criteria\" favoured by consumers. At last month\\'s council session a splinter group of small producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on exportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia and the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations unchanged, except for some temporary adjustments. A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now supported their cause. The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed readiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota accord in October also looked bleak. The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined to make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of quota shares based on \"objective criteria.\" ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets in September. Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee, they said. They said Brazil\\'s reluctance to open coffee export registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another price slide and force an emergency ICO council session, which would most likely end in failure. Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation but had only a general discussion about how further negotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said. Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then may set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not fixed, he said. The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local time to hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The board meeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled, delegates said. Reuter ',\n",

              "  'YUGOSLAVIA WINS TIME IN PARIS CLUB REFINANCING\\n\\nYugoslavia has won breathing space from its major official creditors through yesterday\\'s Paris Club refinancing agreement but it will take time for it to resolve its economic crisis, economists at western embassies said. Yugoslav delegation chief Finance Minister Svetozar Rikanovic said a refinancing was agreed for 475 mln dlrs of debt falling due between May 16 this year and May 31, 1988. The agreement was the second multi-year Yugoslav debt refinancing, based on a protocol signed last May which ushered in \"enhanced monitoring\" of Yugoslavia\\'s economy by the IMF. Western economists who follow Yugoslav financial affairs said a similar deal would probably emerge from talks with commercial creditors at the end of this month. But they said the refinancings would only provide a breathing space, because Yugoslavia has to repay 5.5 billion dlrs in 1987. And the country is still struggling to reverse a dramatic decline in export earnings, which have fallen 12.5 pct so far this year, continuing a downward spiral of the past 18 months. The Yugoslav hard currency debt has grown from 1.2 billion dlrs in 1965 to stand at 19.7 billion dlrs at the end of 1986 and is one of the country\\'s most dire economic problems. The debt began to snowball in the 1960s and 1970s due to an excessive investment rate exceeding the growth of the Gross Social Product and necessitating additional foreign borrowing. Rising international oil prices in the 1970s proved to be a serious blow to the country\\'s balance of payments. Deputy Prime Minister Milos Milosavljevic said this month that Yugoslavia had repaid 640 mln dlrs of principal and 325 mln dlrs of interest so far this year. According to official Yugoslav figures, Yugoslavia repaid a record 5.97 billion dlrs in capital and interest in 1986, reducing overall indebtedness by 996 mln dlrs. Mikulic is trying to rein in rampant retail inflation of almost 100 pct a year through price and incomes controls. Janez Zemljaric, also a Deputy Prime Minister, said recently Yugoslavia expected a \"definite measure of understanding\" from its 16 major western creditor nations. Western economists said Yugoslavia has had its way with the Paris Club creditors but that not all creditors were satisfied with its economic performance last year. They said the Paris discussions were heated and emotional. \"Economic factors were balanced by political realities,\" an economist at one of the main embassies here said, but added that creditors had no complaints regarding Yugoslavia\\'s repayment record because it had so far always repaid debts on time. Yugoslavia has refinanced its debt regularly since 1983. In December 1985, it signed a deal with the International Coordinating Committee of 600 commercial banks to refinance maturities arising between January 1, 1985 and end-1988. It had signed bilateral refinancing agreements in March of that year for maturities arising from January 1, 1985 to March 25, 1986, following an agreement in Paris on March 25, 1985. Government ministers told Reuters this month that Yugoslavia had made too great an effort to repay its debts in 1986, at great cost to the economy, and that this was regretted. Mikulic has said Yugoslavia is unlikely to follow Brazil\\'s lead and suspend its debt repayments \"but we have understanding for what that country did.\" Western economists said, however, that Mikulic\\'s remarks, taken with those of his ministers, could be a signal that some problems were seen ahead in refinancing debt repayments. Before the Paris talks, some Yugoslav officials had hinted that Yugoslavia could start to look to the Soviet Bloc for financial support if Belgrade failed to secure the necessary refinancing from western creditors. Sources close to the western creditors, however, said they did not view the threat as serious. REUTER ',\n",

U.K. Authorities have lost patience with Japanese trading practices and said they are seeking ways to retaliate without unleashing a damaging trade war. \"Toshiba\\'s timing seems most unfortunate for the company, as it comes exactly when we are looking for someone to punch,\" one official told Reuters. Earlier, <Toshiba Information Systems (U.K.) Ltd> said it wanted to enter the British business facsimile and key telephone market. A facsimile machine sends printed data over telephone lines, while a key telephone system is used for switching calls within a business, industry sources said. The move by Toshiba comes in the middle of a dispute over Japan\\'s refusal to open up its telecommunications market to foreign companies. \"Toshiba\\'s timing is most extraordinary,\" one official at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said. Tomorrow, the U.K. Government will consider what legal action it can possible take to press for Japanese reform. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has given notice that the U.K. Would fight the Japanese government\\'s attempt to prevent Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L> from taking a significant position in a new Japanese international telecommunications venture. \"We regard this as a test case,\" she told Parliament. But while the U.K. Is keen to see some movement on the issue by Japan, it is also worried that recent anti-Japanese rhetoric may cause developments to get out of hand, officials said. Japanese officials in Tokyo today reiterated that Japan had no plans to bow to U.K. And U.S. Pressure to give foreign telecommunications firms a bigger role there. The government, for which competition and the deregulation of markets are major political themes, is unlikely to make final decisions tomorrow on how to act against Japan, officials said. Detailed consideration of the issue has been shelved during Thatcher\\'s official visit to the Soviet Union, which ends today. \"We are waiting for the Prime Minister to decide what to do. The DTI will pass the ball to her as soon as she returns tonight,\" a DTI official said. He said Toshiba\\'s application would be considered by the Office of Telecommunications (OFTEL). An OFTEL spokeswoman said \"a decision on this application will take weeks, maybe months.\" Asked whether Toshiba\\'s bid would fall victim to British retaliation, the OFTEL spokeswoman said: \"Who knows what\\'s going to happen given the current situation!\" A Toshiba executive, who asked not to be named, told Reuters: \"We do not anticipate any special problems.\" Some analysts queried by Reuters questioned the basis of Britain\\'s strong stand on the Cable and Wireless bid. One said that the company\\'s proposal was equivalent to a Japanese company wanting to take a stake in Mercury International, the subsidiary of Cable and Wireless that is the only real competitor of British Telecommunications Plc <BTY.L>. British Corporate Affairs minister Michael Howard leaves for Japan on Saturday. The minister will seek a clear timetable from Japan for easier access for British institutions to Japanese financial markets, reciprocating the easy access Japanese securities houses and banks have to the City of London. Britain has threatened to use its new Financial Services Act to revoke or deny licences to Japanese brokerage houses if it does not get satisfaction. But British authorities would be far from happy if forced to use that weapon, government sources said. Sir Nicholas Goodison, Chairman of the London Stock Exchange, said in New York yesterday that sanctions against Japanese financial institutions operating in the U.K. Would set back London\\'s ambition to become a leading centre for corporate financing and securities trading. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson also warned yesterday of the negative effects that a trade war could have on the British economy. Such a development could hit U.K. Exports and sharply alter the outlook for the next general election in which economic recovery will be one of the government\\'s main themes, political analysts said.

              "  'DOLLAR EUROBONDS END EASIER ON PRIME RATE RISES\\n\\nThe dollar straight sector of the eurobond market ended easier after a subdued day\\'s trading as U.S. Banks began to match yesterday\\'s surprise 1/4 point prime rate hikes by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank, dealers said. The prime rates were raised to 7-3/4 from 7-1/2 pct and the timing of the moves puzzled many dealers. However, reaction here was limited, with shorter dated paper ending steady to 1/4 point easier, while longer dates dipped by 1/4 to 1/2 point.

One dollar straight dealer at a U.S. Securities house commented \"There was, in fact, the odd retail buyer today, but only in small sizes.\" He added that, ironically, the prime rate rises may help the market to stabilise since the dollar rose on the back of the news. The only U.S. Dollar deal launched during the day was, as has been the case recently, equity linked. The 15-year convertible bond was for the Bank of Tokyo Ltd and has an indicated coupon of two pct.

He said that while the U.S. Treasury regretted Brazil\\'s interest payment moratorium on commercial bank debt, \"We hope and believe they\\'ll resolve this through direct negotiations (with the banks).\" Baker said the financial community around the world believes it imperative that Brazil come up with a comprehensive program to adjust its economy. In other comments on foreign debt, Baker said the situation has improved since mid-1982 because the banks are in much better shape and have rebuilt reserves. He also noted interest rates are considerably lower today than they were when the crisis broke out and the rate of increase in debt has slowed considerably. In addition, Baker noted a number of debtors are making reasonably good economic progress, and he cited Mexico in particular. He pointed out that Venezuela, Chile and the Philippines have all reached agreement with commercial banks on debt rescheduling and Argentina was in the midst of negotiations. But he rejected calls for \"overnight solutions\" to the debt crisis. \"There is no chance they can get out (of the debt crisis),\" Baker said, unless debtor countries generate economic growth. Baker said the U.S. initiative to shore up debtor nations depends on that concept, and he rejected calls for debt forgiveness, which, he said, would cut debtor nations off from access to private credit. Baker noted that even though Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) was urging debt relief in his strategy for dealing with the debt situation, \"More and more now, he bases this on the concept of growth.\" Other indicators of progress include, Baker said, debtor nations negotiating better and better terms with commercial banks. \"The points over LIBOR are much less,\" he said.

The borrower is a state backed, public corporation which provides 70 to 85 pct of the single-family residential mortgages in Alaska. It is the first U.S. Municipality to arrange these types of facilities in the international capital markets. The seven-year revolving credit has a commitment fee of 0.10 pct per annum, under which drawings will be at 5/16 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor). The facility also incorporates a swing-line facility, which would allow for same day drawings in the U.S. Market for up to three business days at the floating U.S. Prime rate. Credit Lyonnais is acting as coordinator for this facility. Merrill Lynch is agent for the revolving facility, which was lead managed by Swiss Bank Corporation (San Francisco branch). The facility will allow the borrower to issue direct unsecured advances in U.S. Dlrs with maturities of up to six months. It also will be able to issue on an uncommitted basis euronotes with maturities of up to six months, which will be priced under the issuer-set margin system. Although Alaska Housing Finance will set the interest rates relative to Libor for the euronotes, Merrill Lynch noted that it would not seek to issue the notes with a margin in excess of 0.2125 pct per annum. The euro-commercial paper program allows for the issuance of notes with maturities of up to 183 days.

              "  \"AUSTRIAN BANKS DIVIDED OVER INTEREST RATE CUT\\n\\nCalls for a cut in Austrian interest rates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are divided over the issue. Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse und Kommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a cut of up to half a percentage point in interest rates across the board. But Hannes Androsch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> told Reuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers. Vak told a news conference that last January's cut in lending rates for commercial customers and for all depositors by a quarter point had been insufficient. The January cut followed the National Bank's lowering of its discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with a similar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct and deposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct. Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of a point, or even half a point if German rates dropped further. Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. A widening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West German credit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth this year also justified a further interest drop, he said. Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank der oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called for lower deposit rates but said lending rates should remain unchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small, particularly when compared with other West European countries. But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unless West German rates came down first. Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower rates alone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcoming opposition from Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank. REUTER \",\n",

Under the agreement, the oil drilling equipment and oil services company will pay reduced quarterly interest payments on part of its bank revolving credit loans and industrial revenue bonds. Remaining interest will be deferred until Jan 1, 1991. Principal payments will be deferred, with semi-annual payments of 1.75 mln dlrs to start on Dec 31, 1989 and all remaining principal due Jan 1, 1991. Additional interest and principal payments may be due on the bank revolving credit lines if the company generates more cash than it needs for operations. Term of the debt held by insurance company lenders will be extended by one year until December 1990 by reducing the principal due last year and this year. Otherwise, interest and principal payments will continue to be made as scheduled in the existing agreements.

              "  'CURRENCY INTERVENTION TIMING CRUCIAL - ANALYSTS\\n\\nThe dollar\\'s recent decline, despite massive central bank purchases, is a forceful reminder that official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if it is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals or sentiment, dealers and analysts said. Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend, but, without accompanying policy changes, they stand little chance of reversing the direction of an ever-growing global market in which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day, the sources said. \"Timing and psychology are the key to successful intervention,\" said Jim O\\'Neill, a financial markets economist with Marine Midland Banks Inc. The importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when a change in interest rates boosted the dollar, instantly achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a week through open market intervention. After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to 7-3/4 pct, the first change in the rate since last August, the dollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 147.50 yen, up two yen from Tuesday\\'s New York low. By contrast, monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank of Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion dlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent the dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year low Monday of 144.70 yen. Some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar. The market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a central bank foray, but is no longer mesmerized. \"They\\'ve lost their credibility. The market feels it can take on the central banks and win,\" said Michael Snow, head of treasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp contrast to the success that central banks scored when they joined forces to drive the dollar down following the September 22, 1985, Plaza accord. Then, however, central banks had an easy time of it, because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrial powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to redress massive worldwide trade imbalances. Now, there is no such consensus. The market is saying that the dollar must fall further because the U.S. trade deficit is showing little sign of improvement, while Japan is resisting in a bid to protect its export industries. For its part, the United States is apparently content to let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more than lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group of Five plus Canada to foster stability, dealers say. Specifically, they said the Fed\\'s dollar-buying intervention has been half-hearted, designed more as a political gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the markets. \"It\\'s been pro-forma intervention,\" said Francoise Soares-Kemp, chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais. Because of this discord and the market\\'s momentum for a lower dollar, analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail. \"It\\'s going to take a lot more than the central banks to hold the dollar (at these levels),\" said Snow, who predicts another 10 to 15 pct depreciation. \"There have to be structural changes that occur to make the market stop selling dollars,\" added \"Buying six billion dollars in three weeks is not going to do it.\" Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack, central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar falling to a record low of 1.70 marks, analysts said. Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely. \"I don\\'t think anybody has the stomach for it, because they saw the futility of it in the seventies.\" Indeed, because the market has grown in leaps and bound since then, intervention on an even greater scale would probably be needed to impress the market. Trading volume in London, New York and Tokyo alone last year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day, according to a joint central bank study, about double the previous estimate made just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private research group. There are signs that central banks, too, realize the futility of swimming against the tide. Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier this week that they believed the limits of currency market intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods for bolstering the dollar, such as invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks, are being considered. \"In this era of financial liberalization, it\\'s almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,\" one senior official in Tokyo said.

U.S. officials put down any idea of delaying imposing the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs, despite seemingly contradictory comments by some Administration aides. And, they add, a visit here next week by Japanese trade officials and a visit to Tokyo by a senior State Department official will likely do nothing to change U.S. minds. \"Do not expect the problem to be resolved or the sanctions not to go into effect,\" said a senior U.S. trade official. Reagan last Friday announced that on April 17 he would raise tariffs on certain Japanese exports to penalize Japan for breaking a 1986 pact governing trade in semiconductors. The United States says the Japanese have not lived up to their pledge to stop dumping semiconductors in third country markets at less than production costs or to open their home market to U.S. semiconductors. Semiconductors - tiny silicon memory chips - are integral components of modern electronic goods ranging from television sets and personal computers to guidance systems on aircraft. Some U.S. officials had hinted that the United States and Japan might come to terms on their semiconductor dispute in time to cancel the planned tariffs, but this has now been dismissed by other senior officials. They noted that negotiations over compliance with the pact had been going on for several months, with little success. Japanese firms this week announced plans to cut chip output and increase U.S. chip imports, but U.S. officials said Japan\\'s move was too late to stave off the American tariffs. The tariffs are to be imposed after a period of public comment, but Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and other officials have said neither the comment period or the U.S. and Japanese trade talks will serve to delay the tariffs. Baldrige predicted the dispute would be resolved, but said \"I\\'m sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out.\" White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that while he hoped something could be done to hold off the sanctions, \"it probably is not likely.\" And U.S. Trade Represenative Clayton Yeutter predicted that Japan would not be able to comply with the pact in time to hold off the new tariffs on goods including personal computers, television sets, power tools and electric motors. Trade analysts said that in any case, the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor dispute was only one of many and trade frictions that will continue until Japan ended a policy of predatory pricing and opened its home market to foreign goods. Other disputes include Japanese prevention of U.S. firms from taking part in building a new eight billion dlr airport near Osaka and selling a wide variety of goods in Japan, including many agriculture products. A new trade row has now arisen over a Japanese decision to limit foreign participation in its telecommunication market. U.S. officials have said the American telecommunications market is open to foreign firms and it was only fair trade to open the Japanese market to 33 per cent foreign participation, as Japan had previously agreed. Britain has also protested the Japanese limitations. American and Japanese negotiators are meeting to try to resolve the issue, officials said, but there was no sign of any early settlement.

The alternatives being explored include a restructuring, leveraged buyout or a takeover of the company by another company, Conrac said.

              "  'U.S. FARM REORGANIZATIONS PROVING COSTLY - GAO\\n\\nU.S. farmers who reorganize their operations to circumvent a cap on federal payments could add 2.3 billion dlrs to the cost of the government\\'s agricultural programs by 1989, the General Accounting Office, GAO, said. \"We estimate that should the trend in farm reorganizations continue, reorganizations since 1984 could be adding almost 900 mln dlrs annually to program costs by 1989,\" GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley said. \"Cumulative costs for the six-year period, 1984 to 1989, could approach 2.3 billion dlrs,\" he said. Between 1984 and 1986, reorganizations added almost 9,000 new persons to U.S. Agriculture Department payment rolls, Crowley told the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat, Soybeans and Feedgrains. The GAO said at least part of the recent proliferation of reorganizations was attributable to farmers\\' efforts to avoid payment limits, although exactly how many subdivisions were prompted by that concern were impossible to determine. Crowley said the two areas of primary concern were the formation of corporations and the renting of farmland for cash by individuals, partnerships or joint ventures with a large number of participants. Subcommittee Chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said evidence that a \"few bad apples\" were using imaginative techniques to skirt the payment limit jeopardized the \"political credibility\" of U.S. farm programs. Without elaborating, Glickman said the committee would consider legislation to \"ensure than no one is tarnishing the good name and the political support and popular support which American agriculture so richly deserves.\" To improve the effectiveness of payment caps, Congress could require that payments made to corporations, limited partnerships or trusts be attributed to the individual payment limitation of persons who are shareholders, members or beneficiaries of those entities, Crowley said. \"Attribution could be made at some specified level of ownership interest such as five or ten pct,\" Crowley said. Currently, such entities qualify for an individual 50,000 dlr payment as long as no stockholder owns or controls more than 50 pct of the stock. Crowley also suggested that payments could be restricted to persons actively engaged in farming in some manner other than just supplying financing. The Reagan administration proposed similar changes in legislation it sent to Congress last month. Crowley said the GAO investigation uncovered problems with USDA\\'s administration of the payment limitation that contributed to \"the creation of new persons through reorganization that are of questionable validity.\" Specifically, USDA county offices have inconsistently applied a regulation requiring a reorganization to involve a \"substantive\" change in the farming operation in order for any new persons to qualify for payments. In addition, GAO found USDA officials in California were incorrectly interpreting regulations relating to financing of general partnership operations. Crowley also reported that in 401 U.S. counties having about 90 pct of all foreign-owned cropland for all major crops, total farm payments to foreign owners were 6.2 mln dlrs in 1984 and 7.7 mln in 1985. However, payments in 1985 represented only about 0.4 pct of all payments made in the 401 counties, he said. Reuter ',\n",

              "  \"HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP\\n\\nFresh, heavy rains caused further damage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the week to yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, trade sources said. They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum crops were damaged and yield estimates affected. New production forecasts were made for all these crops. The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and worsened the flooding in various parts of the province. The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aires have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue. The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains. In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of 200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres area bordering on Uruguay. In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm in places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm. The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa. Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be further delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said. The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the crops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added. Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to 30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces. The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has been lowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lower than the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season. The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86. The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. It will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weather permitting. Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mln tonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4 to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private producers put 1985/86 production. The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production. The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers' targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week. The production forecast was reduced to between three and 3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4 to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes. The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86. The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least changed in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to 7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes. These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season's record of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources, and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes. The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the sunlight needed for this crop, sources said. Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down further. The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier in the season. Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. Reuter \",\n",

              "  'AUSTRALIA STOCK EXCHANGES ENTER NEW ERA\\n\\nThe Australian Stock Exchange Ltd (ASX) today took up the responsibility for administering a new coordinated market made up of Australia\\'s six former exchanges, now operating as subsidiary trading floors. At the same time, rules prohibiting corporations and non-stock-exchange members from holding more than 50 pct of Australia\\'s 101 brokerage firms were abolished, leaving brokers exposed to greater deregulation. Industry sources said the moves will smooth the changeover to screen-based trading and give the equities market one voice. Westpac Banking Corp <WSTP.S> was one of the first to take advantage of the changes by announcing today it would double its stake in the Sydney firm <Ord Minnett Ltd> to 100 pct. Brokers have been introduced to creeping deregulation over the past three years after legislation passed in 1984 to end restrictive trade practices forced the traditional partnerships to open themselves at first to partial ownership by outside institutions, and eventually to full ownership. The phase-in period has ended, and several major banks and offshore financial institutions are investigating taking larger stakes in Australian broking houses, industry sources said. Though deregulation was all but forced on brokers, most now acknowledge that the influx of capital and contacts from non-member shareholders has benefited the industry, they said. \"Deregulation has brought an infusion of additional capital and a broader base of products,\" ASX chairman Ian Roach told Reuters. Roach said fears that major bank shareholders would impose a restrictive and conservative \"bank culture\" on the dynamic sharebroking industry were unfounded. \"So far the banks have been mindful of the importance of preserving the entrepreneurial aspect of sharebroking,\" he said. But some brokers said others are sceptical and expect that the expiration of \"golden handcuff\" pacts, which tied partners to their firms for a period after incorporation, could cause a massive talent drain. Several leading brokers have already announced plans to leave their firms and establish new private client businesses, while others plan public floats. While bank shareholders have enjoyed dabbling in broking during Australia\\'s record two-and-a-half year bull run, they could find themselves without the expertise they need during more difficult times, some brokers said. Rene Rivkin, head of Sydney brokerage house <Rivkin James Capel Ltd>, said many brokers will resist anything that restricts their individuality and entrepreneurial spirit, and this could leave new entrants into the business short-staffed. \"If I were a bank I\\'m not sure I would have gone into broking.... What\\'s going to happen when a lot of these golden handcuffs come to an end?\" Rivkin said. \"Only then will the banks know what they\\'ve got,\" he said. Rivkin\\'s firm is 50 pct owned by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp <HKBH.HK> unit <Wardley Australia Ltd> and plans a public float of between 25 and 30 pct. \"My relationship with the Hong Kong bank is wonderful. They leave me alone and give me all the support I need.... Maybe if we weren\\'t doing so well there wouldn\\'t be that support, but that hasn\\'t happened,\" he said. Other firms might not be so lucky, he said, and they could find it difficult to preserve their independence when the bull market ends. In the last two years, the value of the Australian sharemarket has leapt 118 pct with turnover value up 152 pct to 31.24 billion dlrs in the year to June 30, 1986. That growth put existing trading systems and clearing houses under pressure, and unification of the six sovereign exchanges should accelerate the development of screen-based trading and a single clearing house, industry sources said. From July this year 30 leading stocks will be traded in a pilot of the ASX\\'s screen trading system which, depending on its reception by brokers, is expected to replace trading floors over the next four years, industry sources said.

              "  'WALL STREET STOCKS/PACIFIC GAS <PCG>\\n\\nPacific Gas and Electric Co\\'s plan to change its accounting methods for nuclear plant revenues, together with the prospect of higher higher domestic interest rates, helped push the company\\'s stock price down 2-1/8 to 22, utility analysts and company executives said. Pacific Gas said yesterday that a change in the method for accounting for its Diablo Canyon Nuclear power plant revenues will result in a 470 mln dlr reduction in 1987 earnings. The company also said it intends to continue paying its common stock dividend at the current annual rate of 1.92 dlrs per share. But the move also means that the company is not likely to increase its dividend for perhaps as long as three years, said Mark Luftig, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. \"Anybody looking for a dividend increase has been dissapointed (by the announcement),\" Luftig said. Pacific Gas has raised its common stock dividend on a regular basis for the past 10 years, a company spokeswoman said. In addition, she also pointed out that prospects for higher interest rates may also be affecting Pacific Gas trading activity. Citicorp <CCI> and Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB> yesterday increased their prime lending rates to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 pct. It was the first rate increase by the big banks in nearly three years. Utility earnings are sensitive to interest rate increases because of the high levels of borrowings needed to finance ongoing construction projects. Despite the market reaction, First Boston Corp analyst Arlene Barnes applauded the Pacific Gas decision. \"This is a very prudent move on management\\'s part,\" said Barnes. Rather than using accounting tools to reflect income it is not taking in, the company will now account for only the 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plant that regulators are allowing in the form of interim rate relief, Barnes said. Pacific Gas had been carrying the other 60 pct as a deferred cash receivable and accounted for the non-cash item as income. \"They\\'ll take the hit this year, but at least we\\'ll be looking at an honest earnings picture,\" Barnes also said.

              "  'U.S.-JAPAN TALKS SEEN NO DELAY TO TARIFFS\\n\\nPresident Reagan\\'s move to impose stiff tariffs on Japanese goods stems from deep U.S. frustration over Japan\\'s trade policy, and he has no intention of calling off the sanctions, trade analysts said. U.S. officials put down any idea of delaying imposing the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs, despite seemingly contradictory comments by some Administration aides. A visit here next week by Japanese trade officials and a visit to Tokyo by a senior State Department official will likely do nothing to change the U.S. decision, they added. \"Do not expect the problem to be resolved or the sanctions not to go into effect,\" said a senior U.S. trade official. Reagan last Friday announced that on April 17 he would raise tariffs on certain Japanese exports to penalize Japan for breaking a 1986 pact governing trade in semiconductors. Some U.S. officials had hinted the United States and Japan might settle their dispute in time to hold off the tariffs, but this has now been dismissed by other senior officials. They noted that negotiations over compliance with the pact had been going on for several months, with little success. Japanese firms this week announced plans to cut chip output and increase U.S. chip imports, but U.S. officials said Japan\\'s move was too late to stave off the American tariffs. The tariffs are to be imposed after a period of public comment, but Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said any settlement would probably come too late to delay the tariffs. U.S. Trade Represenative Clayton Yeutter predicted Japan would not be able to comply with the pact in time to hold off the new tariffs on goods including personal computers, television sets, power tools and electric motors. Trade analysts said that in any case the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor dispute was only one of many, and trade frictions will continue until Japan ended a policy of predatory pricing and opened its home market to foreign goods. Other disputes include Japanese prevention of U.S. firms from taking part in building a new eight billion dlr airport near Osaka and selling a wide variety of goods in Japan, including an array of agricultural products. A new row has now arisen over Japan\\'s decision to severely limit foreign participation in its telecommunication market. U.S. officials have said the American telecommunications market is open to foreign firms and it was only fair trade to open the Japanese market to 33 pct foreign participation, as Japan had previously agreed. Britain has also protested the Japanese limitations. Reuter ',\n",

              "  'TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER <PCC>\\n\\nEmery Air Freight Corp topped a leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40 mln dlrs, but Wall Street is reacting as though another offer may surface. Purolator\\'s stock climbed 5-3/8 today, to 40-1/8, 1/4 over Emery\\'s 40 dlr per share offer. Emery topped a 35 dlr per share or 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc. Some analysts said the latest, 306 mln dlr offer for Purolator exceeded their expectations. Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share range. At least one, however, estimated the company could be taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share. Analysts today would not venture to say whether another offer could be made, but some arbitragers still held to the belief that the bidding could go higher. \"They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer. Emery has shown the courage to go forth,\" said one arbitrager, who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as bidders. \"It makes sense,\" said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey. But \"It won\\'t make out as well as they think. They won\\'t get a 100 pct of the synergies.\" Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in the short term, but long term, after eliminating redundancies and selling other Purolator assets, it should boost Emery\\'s profitability. Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival United Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. package delivery company after Federal Express Corp <FDX>, which has 47 pct of the market. Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator would have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery business. \"This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight (delivery) business, but it will not make them a power house,\" said Douglas Arthur of Kidder, Peabody and Co. Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer, and its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call. E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer, but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST. One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely Hutton will attempt another offer. However, he was skeptical a company outside the package delivery industry would want to outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same synergies as a courier company. Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some of its management and the E.F. Hutton Group <EFH> subsidiary, speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come. The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator board member, Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said he believed a better offer could be made by another entity. A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had no contact with Emery, nor did he have any other buyers lined up for Purolator. Purolator\\'s deal with Hutton was also called into question by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week, which attempted to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth. Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday. Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to keep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279 mln dlr \"bridge\" loan that would later be replaced with other debt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator. Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its 279 mln dlr loan. Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mln dlrs. Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs in revenues. Reuter ',\n",

Polaroid rose 1-1/8 to 74-1/2. \"Speculation that Edelman was going to take a stake in Polaroid was kicking around a few months ago, and resurfaced today,\" one trader said.

A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been contacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with the Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the company. \"There is some hope among investors that there will some progress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patent infringement suit with Kodak,\" analyst Michael Ellmann of Wertheim and Co said.

              "  'NY ANALYSTS SEE COFFEE FUTURES FALLING FURTHER\\n\\nNew York coffee futures prices will probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a consolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts. Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00 dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the International Coffee Organization did not place new export quota discussions on its current agenda. Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five years of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February. \"Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents, perhaps 85 cents,\" said William O\\'Neill, coffee analyst with Elders Futures. \"But the additional downside may not be all that great from current levels.\" \"At this price level the market is very vulnerable to bullish developments,\" O\\'Neill added. \"Rather than us having a market that will plummet we\\'ll kind of see prices erode -- probably to around 85 cents.\" \"I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief drop to 85 cents,\" said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor, with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time. A trader at a major international trade house, who asked not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high export price and requires a high contribution quota from exporters the market could steady at the lower levels. Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on Brazil to agree to consumers\\' export quota terms, and a new international agreement could come into force next fall. Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and demand. Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will need to do some buying soon. \"Most producing nations have just completed or are about to complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly overburdened,\" said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson Lehman, in that firm\\'s forthcoming quarterly coffee report. Kaul said producers\\' need to procure hard currency to service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell, and \"this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows.\" Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before Brazil\\'s frost season begins in June. Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by, though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is passed and demand usually slows this time of year. Shearson\\'s Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags compared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdown for the usually busy winter roasting season. But Elders O\\'Neill said, \"The roasters are not overstocked by any means.\" Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult, given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory below the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short term.

              "  'ENERGY/U.S. REFINING\\n\\nU.S. refiners said they are worried that growing supplies of imports, proposed federal environmental regulations, and the marketing of a third grade of unleaded gasoline would cost them dearly and at a time when the industry is recovering from a recent slump. \"We have to look at national security and cut the amount of products and crude coming into the country if it hurts the industry,\" said Archie Dunham, vice president of petroleum products at Conoco, subsidiary of DuPont Corp (DD). U.S. oil imports account for about 38 pct of U.S. consumption but are expected to rise to 50 pct by the mid 1990s, according to the Department of Energy. \"Can we afford to import 60 or 70 pct of our oil requirements 15 or so years from now?\" asked John Swearingen, chairman of the board of Continental Illinois Corp <CIL> and former chief executive of Amoco Corp <AN>. \"If your answer to that question raises doubt, then it behooves us to do all that we can now to cope with this situation and improve our position.\" But Swearingen said he opposed the idea of an import fee, a view echoed by others attending this week\\'s National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas. \"Talk of an import surcharge or controls is not encouraging because those things won\\'t solve our problems and could well compound them,\" said Swearingen. \"Once the government affects values, once an import quota or license has value, it\\'s going to be subverted by government,\" he added. William Martin, deputy Energy Secretary, said the costs of an import fee outweigh its benefits and suggested, as Energy Secretary John Herrington has, depletion tax credits to encourage domestic production and limit oil imports. He also said altnerative energy sources should be encouraged. Restoration of the depletion allowance for a 27 pct deduction from the taxable income of oil companies is controversal but might work, said Dunham. Dunham and other officials opposed the idea of a fee on oil imports but said if one is enacted it must tax crude and product imports. \"Why would companies import crude when they could import products for a smaller cost if there were only a fee on crude?\" asked Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum <CNP>. An import fee would raise the costs of U.S. petrochemical products and make them noncompetive on the world market, Dunham said. \"The energy security issue should be considered when environmental issues are considered,\" Martin said. \"The level of investment for the proposed lowering of sulfur level of diesel to 0.05 pct by weight, for example, is unacceptable,\" Dunham said. \"Most companies cannot afford it.\" George Unzelman, president of HyOx, Inc., said these proposals \"will place pressure on small refining operations and promote further industry consolidation.\" An NPRA survey of of 139 refineries, which was released at the conference, said reducing sulphur content to 0.05 pct weight and aromatics to 20 volume pct aromatics in highway diesel fuel would cost refiners 6.65 billion dlrs. The national average diesel fuel sulfur content in 1986 for the survey respondents was 0.27 weight pct while the average aromatics content was 32 pct. Another possible cost to refiners is the upgrading of facilities to produce a third grade of unleaded gasoline which is beginning to be marketed by some companies. \"What will be the standard octane level in various grades of unleaded gasoline?\" asked Dunham. \"A midlevel grade of unleaded gasoline with an octane level of 89 means an investment has to be made,\" Dunham said. This grade is not warranted, said Crown\\'s Rosenberg. Despite these concerns, refiners are expecting margins to move higher in the next few months. \"We are beginning to see a return in wholesale margins,\" said Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of the refining and marketing company that is to spin off from Diamond Shamrock Corp <DIA>. Margins are higher because the OPEC pact is holding, U.S. stocks of gasoline and heating oil are declining, and gasoline demand is rising as the driving season approaches, he said. \"This summer could be a good season for selling gasoline,\" Hemminghaus said, adding that the new company will be primarily a gasoline producer.

Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchases until the condition of winter and spring crops is better known make new crop wheat more attractive, said George Hoffman, director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company. \"Pillsbury is assuming that they (Soviets) will be offered a subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respond to,\" Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusiness education conference here. But if there are too many constraints placed on a subsidy offer, the USSR will take less than an anticipated four mln tonnes, he said. Hoffman said Pillsbury\\'s internal statistics put Soviet Union wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidy offer. However, if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels, Moscow would likely buy more, he said. \"If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese, I expect they\\'ll take it,\" said Vernon McMinimy, director of commodity research for A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co. McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact on crops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under a subsidy offer. Soviet winter crops did not get off to a good start because of a dry autumn last year, and because of the severe winter \"they probably have had more damage due to winter weather than normal,\" McMinimy said.

He was visiting New York for talks with investors. After successfully countering a takeover bid launched by T. Boone pickens in January, Diamond Shamrock said it would spinoff its refining and marketing operation into Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co before its April 30 annual meeting. Blackburn told Reuters, \"Our advisors told us that a split would give a better share value to investors and that the market would give better multiples for pure refining and marketing and exploration and production plays.\" The two companies are now in the process of organizing themselves to become \"pure plays,\" the executives said. Blackburn said the new company would be a pure exploration and production operation and that he was looking to divest non-oil and gas operations, particularly Diamond Shamrock\\'s coal operations. Blackburn said that \"we are in talks about coal operations but I cannot discuss this further at this time.\" He said the company would have a debt-to-capital ratio of about 38 pct, which could be paid down over time. Blackburn said the company would seek to generate further internal savings from rationalizing operations and personnel reductions. He has set a goal of 73 mln dlrs in internal savings and \"we need to get at least 20 mln dlrs of that savings in 1987,\" Blackburn said. \"I would rather describe this as savings coming from eliminating non-essential activities as we purify the exploration and production business.\" \"There are some people associated with those activities but it is more a matter of cutting and trimming rather than wholesale changes,\" Blackburn said. Blackburn intends to run a tight ship in which dividends will not initially be paid and the resultant savings invested into exploration and production. \"Our goal is to find 20 mln barrels a year in the U.S. to replace our production and I think that we can do this at the level we intend to spend,\" Blackburn said. \"It might be more difficult to find more oil and more oil internationally at these levels,\" he added. Blackburn said that his new company would spend 75 mln dlrs in North America and 90 mln dlrs overseas, mainly Indonesia, in the search for oil and gas reserves. In 1986 Diamond Shamrock produced 82,473 mln barrels a day of oil with 83 pct of that from Indonesia, while gas output was 265.6 mln cubic feet a day of which 98 pct was in the U.S. Blackburn said that he believed he could find oil to replace this production at low costs which were 4.97 dlrs a barrel worldwide and 3.88 dlrs a barrel in the U.S.. Blackburn also said that the company would be willing to buy reserves, \"if we can find the right producing properties at the right price\". Blackburn estimated that oil prices will average about 18 dlrs a barrel this year with average prices received for natural gas at 1.57 dlrs per thousand cubic feet. Blackburn said he currently estimates that at thee prices for its products the company will have a cash flow of about 280 mln dlrs. \"This will mean a net negative cash flow as we pretty much spend our cash flow to find more oil and gas.\" Blackburn said the company will search for both oil and gas \"almost exclusively in estasblished basins\". Roger Hemminghaus, who will be chairman of the new Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co, which last year had sales of approximately 1.6 billion dlrs, told Reuters his company was taking on some debt. \"We are taking on some 400 mln dlrs new debt with three tier financing emphasizing a revolving loan, some term loans and some unsecured private placement and are now in the latter stages of signing an agreement.\" Chemical New York Corp <CHL> is the company\\'s lead banker on the loan, Hemminghaus said. That debt will set the company off at a 60 pct debt-to- capital-ratio, which Hemminghaus said \"is too much. To alleviate that we will hold our capital expenditures down and pay down debt so that at the end of two years that ratio will be reduced to mid 40 pct range.\" Hemminghhaus said that cash flow will be \"plus or minus about 100 mln dlrs a year from earnings and depreciation.\" In terms of major projects, Hemminghaus said that capital expenditures will be 35 mln dlrs to 50 mln dlrs spread over all of the company\\'s projects. Its major project will be a two year upgrading project on its McKee reinery in the Panhandle at 90,000 bpd rated capacity.

Dome reported earnings yesterday. Analysts said the huge loss improves the appeal of a debt accord by underlining company statements that creditors would receive little or nothing under a forced liquidation that could take several years to complete. After several months of negotiations with a group of 56 major creditors and other unsecured public debt holders, Dome submitted a complex proposal earlier this month that includes converting debt to equity and extending repayment time. \"They\\'ve had their talks and now they have the proposal, so the banks have to decide whether to accept the restructuring or pull the plug,\" the analyst said. He and others said the huge loss, including writedowns totalling 2.08 billion dlrs before a 571 mln dlr reduction in deferred income taxes, dramatically enforces the company\\'s claim that a 50 pct drop in world oil prices has crippled its financial position. But analysts said the writedown only impacts Dome\\'s balance sheet and does not hurt the company\\'s cash position. \"To a large extent, these writeoffs of the carrying value of assets is really just the bookkeepers catching up to what the stock market has been telling us for a long time, reflecting the collapse in oil prices,\" Peters and Co Ltd analyst Wilf Gobert said. Dome reported it took a 1.20 billion charge in the fourth quarter, before a 305 mln dlr reduction in deferred income taxes, for the decline in value of Dome\\'s oil and gas properties. The extraordinary loss conformed with new Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants guidelines that require Dome to use average 1986 oil prices to value its holdings, instead of an escalating price method used in prior years. Analysts said six individual Swiss noteholders, who initiated legal action against Dome to recover debt of 408,500 dlrs, will also be pressed to adopt a more lenient stand by the 1986 results. \"To the extent that individuals were not fully accepting or cognizant of the seriousness of Dome\\'s financial position, the financial statements reflecting this writedown of the value of assets is certainly going to indicate the depth of the hemorrhaging that has taken place,\" Gobert said. The legal action now before Swiss courts threatens to trigger cross-defaults on all of Dome\\'s debt, toppling the delicate debt negotiations. Dome is next scheduled to appear April six to defend against the action. First Marathon Securities Ltd analyst Rick Hallisey said the size of the loss was slightly larger than industry estimates of Dome\\'s negative net worth, ranging between 1.50 billion and two billion dlrs. \"What this writedown says is that a lot of the money that was spent in the past is unrecoverable, but the shareholders have already recognized that through the writedown in the stock price,\" Gobert said, adding, \"The financial statements have come out and said that what has happened in the past has been a disaster for Dome,\" Gobert added. The price of Dome common shares fell five cts to 1.05 dlrs in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange today. At the height of Dome\\'s success in 1981, common traded at about 25 dlrs a share.

As a result, the bank\\'s net income for the first quarter will be reduced by about 40 mln dlrs.

If no interest payments are received for the rest of the year from Ecuador, which is recovering from a severe earthquake, 1987 earnings will be cut by a further 10 mln dlrs. But, \"barring substantialy increased instabilities in developing countries,\" BankAmerica said it continues to anticipate an operating profit in 1987. In the first quarter of 1986 BankAmerica earned a profit of 63 mln dlrs but turned in a loss of 518 mln dlrs for the year as a whole. BankAmerica also said it completed yesterday the previously announced sale of its discount brokerage subsidiary, Charles Schwab Corp. The sale was part of a program of asset disposals undertaken to staunch losses at the nation\\'s second largest bank holding company. BankAmerica stressed that it expects Brazil will eventually reach a debt rescheduling agreement which will provide for the payment of interest being deferred in 1987. \"Negotiations will be complicated and lengthy, but we continue to expect that a rescheduling agreement will be completed this year,\" said A.W. Clausen, BankAmerica\\'s chairman and chief executive officer. \"For the interim period, however, we concluded that the responsible procedure would be to record income only as we receive payments on the loans,\" he added in a statement. U.S. banks are not legally required to place loans on non-accrual until interest becomes more than 90 days overdue. By striking accrued, but unpaid, interest from their accounts earlier than necessary, the banks are signalling to Brazil their readiness to dig in for a long fight over the terms of the rescheduling agreement regardless of the short-term earnings impact, banking analysts said. Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of its 109 billion dlr foreign debt in February, citing a drop in official reserves, and said interest payments would be held on deposit at the central bank pending a rescheduling.

A committee of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians discussed the offer but after three hours they had not come to any decision. If the union walks out it would mean simultaneous strikes against all three major U.S. television networks. A different union struck CBS Inc <CBS> and Capital Cities/ABC Inc <CCB> a month ago. NBC is owned by the General Electric Co <GE>. \"We\\'re instructing all our members to continue working without a contract,\" said John Krieger, a union official. The contract expired at midnight March 31. Krieger said the committee is empowered to call a strike if it sees fit but he added, \"we\\'re not gun shy and we\\'re not strike-happy, we don\\'t take it lightly.\" He said the union needed time to draft a formal response to the NBC proposal, which the network billed as its \"best and final offer.\" A spokeswoman for NBC said management personnel were prepared to take assume technical duties if its radio and television facilities are struck. \"If there were a strike, we would not expect any interruption in our service,\" the NBC spokeswoman said. At CBS and ABC, where the Writers Guild of America has been on strike since early March, viewers have noticed little difference in the programs. However technicians are not involved in the walkout at CBS and ABC. Krieger said the \"major stumbling block\" in the talks with NBC was the network\\'s insistence on having the right to hire engineers and writers on a daily basis. \"In a broad sense this would decimate the union,\" he said, with temporary workers jeopardizing the jobs of staff employees. NBC said its proposal \"contains assurances that there is no intention to replace regular employees with daily hires.\" NBC said regular employees who may be on layoff would be offered employment first. NBC also said any daily hires would be represented by the union and would be phased in at four pct of regular staff in the first year of a contract and six percent afterward. Top scale wages would increase to 855 dlrs per week in the first year of the two-year contract and 895 dlrs in the second year, under the NBC proposal. Krieger said the network\\'s wage proposals were \"disappointing\" but not the main issue. NBC said its proposals would give it greater flexibility in sports and news coverage. It said its proposals would permit limited access to news materials from affiliates and subscription services and allow Cable News Network to join network pool facilities. Cable News Network is owned by Turner Broadcasting System <TBS>. Material from subscription servoces would be limited to an average of about one minute in a half-hour program, NBC said. The network said the changes it seeks \"would reduce costly duplication and are vital to NBC\\'s long term health.\" The major U.S. networks have experienced cost cutting campaigns following a series of ownership changes that affected the parent companies of all three in the past two years. Laurence Tisch became the largest shareholder in CBS, NBC\\'s former parent RCA was acquired by General Electric and ABC was merged into Capital Cities Broadcasting. The broadcast operations have been hit with layoffs and other belt-tightening measures. Network executives cited cable television services and video cassette players which compete for viewers.

However, some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond futures have left the bond market somewhat oversold, and the contracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery before resuming their decline. Key to the near-term direction of futures will be the course of the dollar, they said. \"As the dollar goes, so goes the bond market,\" said Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs. The recent decline in the dollar, which hit a 40-year low against the Japanese yen Monday, was reversed Wednesday when several large U.S. money center banks unexpectedly raised their prime lending rates by a quarter point, to 7-3/4 pct. \"Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar, foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline is over,\" Gibbs said. The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt futures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation. Indeed, the falling dollar may have been a key topic at the meeting of the Federal Reserve\\'s policy making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, this week, analysts said. \"To the Fed, the combination of a falling dollar, a steepening yield curve, and rising commodity prices look suspiciously like the traces of expectations of accelerating inflation,\" said Denis Karnosky, analyst at Carroll, McEntee and McGinley Inc. Such expectations could mean that \"a shift in policy toward restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious consideration,\" at the FOMC meeting, he said. Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highly visible form of monetary tightening, Karnosky said. Rather, the key to detecting a change will be found in seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window, he said. Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mln dlrs over the past several months, he said. In the meantime, however, \"the market looks a bit oversold,\" said Jim Wysoglad, analyst at Golden Gate Futures. Wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition could drive June bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to test chart support near the recent low of 97-13/32. Technician Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston said that the key test for June bonds will be whether the nearby contract holds above chart support at 96-24/32. \"All previous selloffs since mid-November have stopped and buyers have surfaced at that level,\" Keefe said. If that level is broken, and the dollar continues to decline, Keefe said she expects the June bond contract to decline to test support between 92 and 93, the primary uptrend line dating back to 1984.

In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital. \"This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices,\" she said. Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall another 10 cents to 15 cnts a pound, analysts said.

The proposals were approved as amendments to a comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year. In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committee approved several proposals which could restrict imports of lamb, casein, sugar-containing products and tobacco. Those amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because the House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall jurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them, Congressional sources said. The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than the current three years through fiscal 1988. The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., also would increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion now. Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered by Rep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Department to value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisition value. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct less expensive to operate. The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered by Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., does not require the administration make an offer, but urges such action. The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to begin discussions with other major grain producing countries aimed at jointly reducing world grain production. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the amendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work. Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved by the panel, the most significant would require quotas on imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm product that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment, offered by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily at curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and foreign foods containing dairy products. It also may affect peanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said. Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports of casein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by New Zealand and Ireland. The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S. beef imports. Other miscellaneous amendments included: -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove restrictions on beef imports. -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shipped each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to 800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now. -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to determine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier. -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the National Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for the costs of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against a Canadian countervailing duty case this year. -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision to apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by the European Community to apply a vegetable oils tax. -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a National Commission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended a reorganization of USDA's trade policy apparatus.

Wilhelm Christians said. Credit business declined in the first few weeks of the year, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weak German bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, and trading in securities also fell. But earnings from currency dealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference. Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78 billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balance sheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion. Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the former Flick group, which have been estimated at some one billion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank\\'s own account, not included in partial operating profits. Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through a subsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interest surplus in a section current earnings from securities and participations. In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from 1.45 billion. As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits. But it said that total operating profits, including own account trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flick transaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in the parent bank. Banking analysts said this put group total operating profits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bank operating profits at over five billion marks. Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earnings from Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its unchanged 12 mark dividend. The bank had decided against raising the dividend itself because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986, and developments so far this year showed that was correct, Christians said. West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they are sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent years, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits. The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a high level of risk provision, Christians said. Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in 1986 from 765 mln in 1985. Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarily reflect the full amount of risk provisions. Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said Deutsche\\'s total debt exposure to problem countries had fallen to over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985 because of the fall in the dollar. He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds of such problem country debt had been written off. Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of \"other securities,\" to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in the parent bank. Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly due to its increased activity in international share placements, with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA\\'s international placement last year remaining on its books. Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned to place these shares and conclude the original placement. Reuter ',\n",

Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding from Deutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal with Creditanstalt. Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover of Lloyds Bank plc <LLOY.L> were without foundation, he said. Herrhausen said Deutsche had taken part in the recent capital increase of <Morgan Grenfell Group plc>, but had no plans to raise its 4.4 pct share in Morgan Grenfell. <Banca d\\'America e d\\'Italia SpA>, in which 98.3 pct was acquired from Bankamerica Corp <BAC.N> late last year, would be consolidated this year, and contribute to further expansion of Deutsche\\'s business, management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said. Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal High Court, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in the balance sheet section \"participations,\" Christians said. But Christians said the bank still regarded shares in these non-bank companies as an investment rather than an active participation. Parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marks in 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a rise to 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations. Herrhausen said the grouping of holdings in the balance sheet in this was was not a first step to floating them off in a separate holding company. Reuter ',\n",
              "  'WORLD RECESSION UNLIKELY - DEUTSCHE\\'S HERRHAUSEN\\n\\nA world recession is unlikely this year as fiscal and monetary policy in most industrialized countries is supporting the economy, Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said. But growth rates will be smaller than last year, with 1.5 to 2.5 pct likely in most industrialized countries, he told a news conference. Herrhausen said he was confident private consumption would support economic growth in West Germany this year, with net income increases turning into purchasing power as long as inflation did not revive. Herrhausen said he did not expect interest rates to rise in West Germany this year, but there was little room for further falls. Rates in the U.S. were however rising, as evidenced by the latest prime rate moves, but this rise would be moderate. Herrhausen said he did not expect any major narrowing of the U.S. Trade and budget deficits in the next few months. One success of the Paris agreement in February to foster currency stability was that U.S. Officials have stopped talking down the dollar, he noted. The recent stability would last until markets decided to test the resolve of central banks, he said. He noted that central banks had spent some 10 billion dlrs this week to stabilize the dollar against the yen in the first such test. \"A massive attack on the mark, which could come if we get bad news out of the U.S., Would require a much higher intervention amount, raising the danger of inflation,\" he said. Turning to the international debt problem, Herrhausen said Brazil\\'s unilateral debt moratorium had surprised banks. But the move showed that a real solution to debt problems was only possible with the involvement of all parties. Reuter ',\n",
              "  \"SINGAPORE BANKS SAY DIVERSIFICATION KEY TO GROWTH\\n\\nSingapore's major banks are diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from loans to debt instruments, banking sources said. The banks following the trend are the <Overseas Union Bank Ltd>, <United Overseas Bank Ltd>, <Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation> and the <Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>. The shift towards securitisation has been helped by volatile financial markets which have developed hedging facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk management, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun. Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks see limited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are switching from term lending to major growth areas such as stockbroking and fee based income, he said. Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being granted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now moving into the new government securities market and the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System. One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the Overseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity market in Singapore. Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market has increased business transactions and provided long term growth for the market. The banks are not competition for individual stockbroking firms because of the increased business they generate, he added. Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because of the increasing ability of foreign and local market participants to absorb new issues. Loh said <OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary of the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to launch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors seeking capital growth through a diversified international portfolio. It will invest in international shares with the emphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said. <DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of the Development Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm. Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in Singapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will be forced to provide fund management services for major clients seeking better returns, he said. Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major banks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income from treasury and investment banking activities. They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chinese and United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pct against respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986. Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40 mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said. The Development Bank's after-tax profits rose 39.2 pct in 1986 mainly due to a dividend of 20.4 mln dlrs paid by <National Discount Company Ltd> before it became a subsidiary of the bank, they said.

Susin Suratanakaweekul, president of the Thai Coffee Exporters Association, told Reuters that Thailand obtained little benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented only about 30 pct of its total annual exports. Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if there are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members who offer higher prices than non-members, he said. The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21,404 tonnes of coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985. Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000 tonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 the previous year. However, a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thai government supports coffee producers' lobbying for reimposed ICO quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices. Somphol Kiatpaiboon, director general of the Commercial Economics Department, said an absence of ICO quotas would encourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market, further depressing prices.

The ministry had originally estimated that industrial production fell 3.0 pct in January. The February figure is likely to be revised upwards by just under one percentage point next month when the March figure is released, a ministry statement said. The industrial production index, base 1980, stood at a provisional 104.1 in February against 100.9 in January and 104.5 in December. The ministry had previously put the January and December indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively. In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7, producing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct. The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pct increase in construction output compared with January, when production in many industrial sectors was depressed by unusually severe winter weather. Manufacturing industry registered a 3-1/2 pct rise in production in February compared with January. But energy sector output fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct. The ministry, which considers two-monthly comparisons to be a better guide to trends, said output in January and February together fell around two pct against November and December. The ministry said construction output fell 13-1/2 pct in January/February against November/December due to the cold January weather. Output in the energy sector rose four pct and mining output 10 pct. Manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct in January/February compared with November/December. Within this sector, the output of both basic products and of food, tobacco and alcohol fell 1-1/2 pct. Production of capital goods fell 2-1/2 pct while output of consumer goods was unchanged. Compared with the same months of 1986, industrial production in January and February 1987 fell 1-1/2 pct, the ministry said. Manufacturing industry output fell one pct, with output of basic products down three pct, capital goods down one pct and food, tobacco and alcohol production 1-1/2 pct lower. Makers of consumer goods posted a 1-1/2 pct year-on-year rise in the two-month period. In other industrial sectors, mining production fell four pct and construction output 4-1/2 pct.

However, the plan, unveiled by senior Federation of Economic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe, does not specify what stake Cable and Wireless would have. \"The share holdings of the core companies should be equal,\" Watanabe said in a statement. \"The actual percentage of shareholdings should be agreed by the core companies.\" He said the eight core companies will provide directors for the firm. \"The new company shall immediately set to work on the feasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself,\" Watanabe said. Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups, one of which included C and W, seeking to compete against <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which now monopolizes Japan\\'s overseas telephone business. The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wants only one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe\\'s efforts. A British source, who declined to be identified further, said the proposals could open the door to further talks between C and W <CAWL.L> and the other firms involved. C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal which would have given it a five pct share in the new telecommunications firm, compared to the less than three pct stake Watanabe originally proposed. C and W has a 20 pct stake in one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge. The British source said the decision not to specify the exact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the door open for further discussion. \"It\\'s probably a sensible approach on their part,\" the British source told reuters. C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a new cable between Japan and the U.S. The proposed merger has sparked an international row, with British government sources threatening retaliatory action against Japan for what they see as discriminatory practices against foreign firms. The sources said last Friday that one option for Britain would be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London. The U.S. Has also attacked the original merger plans, saying that both rival consortia should be licensed. Asked about participation by other U.S. And European firms, Watanabe said, \"They will not be core companies but if they wish they could participate.\" Under the Japanese law, total foreign participation would be limited to one-third. \"It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which has the support of many influential backers and work within this for the realization of their ideas,\" Watanabe told reporters. The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp <MITT.T>, Mitsui and Co <MITS.T>, Sumitomo Corp <SUMT.T>, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co <MC.T>, Toyota Motor Corp <TOYO.T>, C Itoh and Co <CITT.T>, and <Pacific Telesis International Inc>. Watanabe said that his latest proposal represented his final effort. If it fails to satisfy the British government, it will be up to the Japanese government to explain its position, he said.

Yu Chien-ming, head of the government statistics department, told parliament yesterday he expected the losses to increase as the Taiwan dollar continues to strengthen. The Taiwan dollar, which opened at 34.24 to the U.S. Dollar today, has risen about 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since September 1985. Some bankers expect it to rise to 33 by June and to 32 by the end of this year. Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves now total 53 billion dlrs. At end-February they were 52.1 billion dlrs, the world's third largest after West Germany and Japan. Yu said the interest earned from the reserves totalled about 1.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from July 1986 to February 1987. The reserves are managed by the central bank and deposited at about 170 leading banks in the U.S., Japan, Britain, Canada and Singapore.

Operators feel the foreign exchanges are likely to test sterling on the downside and that this seems to make a fall in U.K. Base lending rates even less likely in the near term, dealers said. The feeling remains in the market, however, that fundamental factors have not really changed and that a rise in U.K. Interest rates is not very likely.

The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system. Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but lower-quality grades, the AWB submission said. It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every stage from receival to shipping. Better industrial relations at grain terminals, more uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock control were vital to improved marketing, it said. The submission also said Australia\\'s federal system impeded the AWB\\'s role of coordinating and managing the marketing of wheat. The AWB called for an end to physical and legislative constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient transport of grains to other states for shipment. \"It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode to the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state in which the wheat is grown or stored,\" it said. For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW) might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than to Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly, southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or Geelong, in Victoria. Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over grain shipments was one notable impediment, it said. The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulk handling authorities is not essential, although it said it favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current level of control of storage and transport as long as quality was maintained. An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between 26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel at various Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houston and 16,300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60,000-tonner.

They said this was despite the fact that the commission accepted over 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention yesterday from traders protesting that rebates are being set too low. The maximum rebate at yesterday's tender was 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos, up from 45.678 Ecus the previous week. London traders said yesterday the rebate was the largest ever granted. The commission sources said today the increase was entirely explained by world market conditions. The amount by which the rebate fell short of what producers claim is needed to obtain an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention remained at 0.87 Ecus per 100 kilos, they said. Operators offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention last month to protest at rebates which they said were too low. The sources said about 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes of German sugar had been accepted, the remainder being rejected as of too low quality. The sources noted the operators could withdraw their offers in the five week period between the acceptance of the sugar and payment for it. They said they saw no sign of planned withdrawals as yet, adding that they would expect operators to wait another week or two to review commission policy before making up their minds. The sources said the commission felt entitled to offer rebates at slightly below the level theoretically justifiable in the light of its 1987/88 farm price package proposal to reduce guaranteed prices for sugar by two pct from the start of the new season in July.

              "  'CHINA TAKES SHARE TRADING OFF REFORM AGENDA\\n\\nChina opened its fifth securities market yesterday, in Tianjin, but share issues and share trading are no longer on the agenda of economic reform, official newspapers and Western diplomats said. One Western diplomat said share issues are on the backburner because they are ideologically too sensitive. The People\\'s Daily said last month that trading shares is \"not compatible with socialist materialist civilisation.\" The newly opened market traded bonds in four state-owned firms and buyers outnumbered sellers, the China Daily said. China\\'s first securities market since 1949 opened last August in Shenyang, followed by markets in Shanghai in September and in Peking and Harbin this year. They trade mostly bonds. \"Bonds are all right. There is no risk to the holder and there is no question of his having any ownership stake in the firm,\" the diplomat said. The People\\'s Daily article said joint stock companies might not be the way to reform large and medium-size state firms nor the model for reforming China\\'s ownership system. Share issues would make the workers owning them think only of the economic advantage of their own firms, rather than the nation as a whole, the People\\'s Daily said. As late as December, officials were pushing the idea of share issues as a way to channel excess cash in the economy into production, reduce the state\\'s investment burden and motivate share-owning employees to work harder. In November, Liu Hongru, deputy governor of the People\\'s Bank of China, told a delegation from the New York Stock Exchange that a long-term funds market should be built up, \"with stocks and bonds issuance as the main form.\" \"Stocks and bonds should be issued through banks, trust and investment companies ... The transfer of securities should be conducted through financial institutions ... The opening up of secondary markets should be studied after trials and experiments,\" Liu said. The subject of share issues and trading was widely covered in the official press last year, usually in a positive way. One of the most far-reaching proposals came from a Peking university professor. He said all but essential state firms should become joint stock holding companies, with the state holding a controlling share that could be as low as 33 pct. The professor argued this would separate government administrators from managers of the firms, a key goal of China\\'s reforms. He said his plan would make the companies independent units under a board of directors. The diplomat said the dropping of share issues may be the result of conservative backlash since the January resignation of reformist Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang. He said share issues raise sensitive questions: \"What happens if the value falls? People are not used to this and may be dissatisfied. What happens if a person gets very rich through share ownership? The government does not want disparity in income.\" One Chinese journalist said conditions are not ripe for widespread share issues. \"In China, the success or failure of a firm does not entirely lie within its own hands. There are many external factors beyond its control,\" he said. \"To make share purchasing attractive, you need a secondary market and perhaps speculators,\" he said. \"But speculation is not acceptable in China.\" Asked if there are political reasons for putting aside share issues, he said that in China economics and politics cannot be separated. \"There is a very major review of the economic reforms going on. There are political factors involved,\" the journalist said. \"If the economy runs well this year, the political pressure will be less.\" Comments by officials of the new Tianjin market echoed his caution. The China Daily quoted one official as saying China does not intend to develop stock exchanges equivalent to those in the West while it has a socialist economic system. \"Given the special circumstances of our country, we must approach the new phenomenon in a contemplative and comprehensive way so as to guide trading onto a healthy track,\" he said.

The company said that this was despite the mark\\'s further strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and despite an increase in competitive pressure. \"The further progress of our business will depend largely on the extent to which threats to free trade materialise and on the developments of exchange rates, raw material and energy costs. Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billion marks in 1986, exceeding the previous year\\'s record of 3.15 billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72 billion from 1.62 billion. The company gave no net profit figures or any indication of the likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985 results, up one mark from a year earlier. Bayer said that world group operating profit declined slightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showed a further improvement. Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to 40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainly the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark. Lower prices on the raw material side had also brought pressure on selling prices, it added. In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against 1985, the company said without giving details. \"The western Europe, North America and Far East regions developed well in local currency, but here too the translation of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture, especially in the case of North America,\" it said. Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in 1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks. Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986, resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combined with savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offset falling prices and cost increases in other areas. The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lower extraordinary expenses and higher net interest income. Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating raw materials all developed well, it said. Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that world group turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last three months of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period. Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pct to 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower and foreign turnover 8.6 pct lower. Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarter against 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985. REUTER ',\n",

But the new market is unlikely to attract many overseas investors, particularly as non-residents will be subject to a withholding tax on interest earned, Loh Hoon Sun, general manager of <Overseas Union Bank Ltd>, said. Overseas Union Bank Ltd is one of the five primary dealers approved to underwrite the auctions and ensure liquidity. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which approved the five underwriters, aims to issue seven billion dlrs of treasury bills, notes and bond issues in the first year. A MAS spokesman said a steering committee has yet to determine details, but most of the new government securities will have a maturity of up to five years and 10-year paper may be issued if demand emerges. Bonds and treasury bills will be issued in denominations of 1,000 dlrs and treasury bills in a minimum denomination of 10,000 dlrs. Bankers said these rates will put the securities within reach of almost everyone and will create a more active market. Allocations will be made first for non-competitive bids from primary dealers prepared to accept average yields on up to 500,000 dlrs worth of notes and bonds and an unlimited volume of treasury bills. The remainder will be awarded to competitive bidders offering the lowest yields. The new market should stimulate the local economy. Funds will come from savings and fixed deposit accounts, \"but just how much will depend on the bond yields,\" Loh told Reuters. Loh said bank interest rates currently stand at 3.0 to 3.5 pct for fixed deposits and the prime rate is 5.5 pct, and these rates are expected to remain fairly steady this year.

Mwape said in a speech to businessmen in the southern town of Livingstone yesterday that the IMF\\'s approach had caused social and political unrest across the continent. There was widespread rioting and looting in Zambia last December after the government abolished subsidies on refined maize meal in line with IMF recommendations. Mwape said told businessmen \"The question which should be asked and answered when designing programmes is who is going to bear the brunt of adjustment ... And what cushion is available to minimise the burden ?\" Zambia has had five IMF adjustment programmes since 1976, the last of which was cancelled in February last year, he said. \"In spite of these, the economy has shown signs of stress, with no significant improvement in a number of areas,\" he added. Zambia has just completed a new round of IMF talks on its foreign exchange system and has obtained enough commercial loans to pay off its IMF arrears for 1985 and 1986, paving the way for a new stand-by credit. Zambian politicians have frequently criticised the fund, however, and diplomats say President Kenneth Kaunda faces consistent opposition inside the ruling party\\'s central committee over dealings with the IMF.

The reports said he told a meeting of supporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party today the proposed five pct tax should be amended if there was anything wrong with it. Officials were not immediately available for comment. Until now, Nakasone had vowed to press on with the tax as part of his plan to reform Japan's 36-year-old tax system. But most Japanese newspapers and news agencies quoted him as saying today he would not foist the tax on the Japanese people if they hated it. Opposition parties and some industry groups say the tax breaks Nakasone general election campaign promises last July and would discourage consumer spending, needed to meet government pledges to try to stimulate economic growth. Pressure for the tax to be amended or shelved is likely to increase soon, before a first round of local elections due on April 12, political analysts said. Resistance has spread from opposition parties and affected industries to the LDP. Some 36 of Japan's 47 provincial governments have called for the plan to be scrapped or handled carefully, government officials said.

A spokesman for the mining house said the action started on Wednesday last week when thousands of miners staged a go-slow at One underground shaft of the Free State Geduld division of Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd <FSCN.J>. The action later escalated into an underground sit-in at the mine over the weekend, prompting management to close the affected shaft because of what the company described as \"the creation of unsafe working conditions.\" Anglo American spokesman John Kingsley-Jones said the company held talks with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), South Africa\\'s biggest trade union which claims a membership of 360,000 black workers, but failed to establish the cause of worker dissatisfaction.

Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126 pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB. \"It looks good,\" Diaz said. But he added several issues, including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares, had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the sale. The PCGG\\'s sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted SMC\\'s bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the UCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares were actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB when he fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24 mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration. \"The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are owned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers,\" Diaz said. \"Naturally we do not want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies.\" PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC\\'s Hong Kong subsidiary Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year. The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally negotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos. PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines\\' largest food and beverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln \"B\" class shares from the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a price of 150 pesos per share. The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso transaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500 mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred shares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollected dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to UCPB-controlled trading companies. The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share made by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend declared in June last year. A spokesman for SMC said the company\\'s 15-member board met today to discuss the proposed compromise. The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board meeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration. President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to set up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership issue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15. Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMC board, filed a formal complaint before the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight other directors of violating \"fiduciary duty.\" De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC\\'s board last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan.

              "  'LAWSON REMARKS DASH HOPES OF EARLY U.K. RATE CUT\\n\\nChancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\\'s remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling, dashing hopes for an early cut in U.K. Base rates, analysts said. But the market\\'s reaction, testing exchange rate levels indicated by Lawson, was probably overdone and the longer term outlook for sterling remained bullish, they agreed. In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy, Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current levels, specifying rates of around 1.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs. Lawson added the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling at about present levels, using currency intervention and interest rates to achieve this. The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to include target ranges, but all participants to the meeting had so far refused to specify these. Markets were quick to react to the statement, chopping about one U.S. Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match the levels mentioned by Lawson. But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawson\\'s statement signalled a change in U.K. Policy. Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said, \"the remarks have been blown out of proportion. Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue.\" Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said, \"there is nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellor\\'s statement.\" He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the Chancellor were precise targets, but merely represented central rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate, perhaps by as much as 10 pct. \"It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election ... I don\\'t believe Lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate,\" Brett said. Currency markets were keen for official statements to clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency trading. This mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said. \"Making similar statements when the market is high strung and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake,\" one senior dealer with a U.S. Bank said. Capel\\'s Skeoch said, \"it gives the foreign exchange markets something to shoot at.\" \"It is obvious that the government, as a member of the Group of Six, has agreed exchange rate bands. But they are not cut in stone, they can change with time,\" Skeoch said. Brett said, \"we think the 2.90 marks level is a central rate. Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine.\" Not all analysts played down the significance of the remarks, however. Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate sterling from the fortunes of the dollar. Although about two-thirds of Britain\\'s trade is conducted with European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed the dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted. \"Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or throw in its lot with Europe,\" Dunn said. \"It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to join the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection by shadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants the U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark,\" he said. Analysts said sterling\\'s dip on currency markets following Lawson\\'s remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term. \"Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some extremely good economic indicators,\" Capel\\'s Skeoch said. Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March, the last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analysts had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards. REUTER ',\n",

The ministry had originally estimated that industrial production fell 3.0 pct in January. The February figure is likely to be revised upwards by just under one percentage point next month when the March figure is released, a ministry statement said. The industrial production index, base 1980, stood at a provisional 104.1 in February against 100.9 in January and 104.5 in December. The ministry had previously put the January and December indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively. In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7, producing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct. The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pct increase in construction output compared with January, when production in many industrial sectors was depressed by unusually severe winter weather. Manufacturing industry registered a 3-1/2 pct rise in production in February compared with January. But energy sector output fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct. The ministry, which considers two-monthly comparisons to be a better guide to trends, said output in January and February together fell around two pct against November and December. The ministry said construction output fell 13-1/2 pct in January/February against November/December due to the cold January weather. Output in the energy sector rose four pct and mining output 10 pct. Manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct in January/February compared with November/December. Within this sector, the output of both basic products and of food, tobacco and alcohol fell 1-1/2 pct. Production of capital goods fell 2-1/2 pct while output of consumer goods was unchanged.

The 66.5 billion franc reduction over the full year mainly reflected a 44.8 billion difference between debt redemption and new foreign borrowings, it said. The 21.4 billion franc reduction in the fourth quarter mainly reflected an 11.4 billion franc difference between redemptions and new borrowing, the ministry added.

The ministry said although the dollar's depreciation favoured a reduction in foreign debt, this was largely offset by the appreciation of other currencies in which 63 pct of French medium and long term debts were denominated at end-1986.

Terry Sanford of North Carolina, the only Democrat to support Reagan, later said he had decided to vote to override when the bill is reconsidered. If no other votes switch, the Senate would override the veto on reconsideration, Senate Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas said. He said Reagan and Administration officials would continue to lobby for votes to sustain the veto. \"As of right now, the vote would be 67 to 33 (in favor of the bill) and the veto would be overriden,\" Dole said. After several hours of delay, Senate leaders were unable to agree on a time for a second vote and the Senate recessed until this morning with the issue unresolved. Sanford denied he had been pressured to change his vote, but told the Senate, \"I have talked to and have been talked to by a number of senators. I have thought a little more deeply about this vote.\" The first Senate vote put Reagan on the verge of a political triumph he had sought to show he is rebounding strongly from the Iran arms scandal.

More than 600 workers in the Visokogradnja construction firm at Titograd left their jobs because they had not been paid for three months, Tanjug said. Yugoslavia has been hit by a wave of strikes after the government introduced a pay freeze in February to try to stem wage rises and almost 100 pct inflation.

Although other firms have developed such superconductive materials, Toshiba scientists said their discovery is the first that allows the material to be formed into a pliable wire. Developing a superconducting material that works at room temperature with no resistance is the object of a frenetic worldwide scientific race. The main applications would be in super powerful magnets, small computers of immense power and speed, electric transmission lines which use negligible power, and electric generators which consume no power. Toshiba said that it will probably be five years before it can incorporate superconductors in marketable machines. But problems still have to be surmounted. Present superconductors, including Toshiba's, need to be cooled to very low temperatures before they can pass electricity with no resistance. This requires costly liguid gas coolants. Superconductors developed to date transmit only small currents and cannot conduct alternating current, only direct current, government scientists said. Toshiba, which spent 190.3 billion yen on research and development in the year ended March 31 1986, counts itself among the leading superconductor research companies in Japan, manager of Toshiba's public relations Yuji Wakayama said..

Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), which claims a membership of over 600,000 workers, most of whom are black, urged labour unions to show solidarity with the striking railwaymen, adding that a key issue in the strike was the freedom of workers to join trade unions of their choice.

The company also said it intends to reduce its second quarter common stock dividend to 35 cts a share from 69 cts. Mellon said it will make a provision for loan losses in the first quarter of 175 mln dlrs, reflecting about 95 mln dlrs in charge-offs and 80 mln dlrs in additions to the loan-loss reserve. It will also put 310 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans on a cash basis, resulting in interest reversals of 10 mln dlrs. In the first quarter of 1986, Mellon earned 60.4 mln dlrs or 2.13 dlrs a share. Chairman David Barnes said the loan charge-offs and increased provisions address four areas of concern in the bank\\'s wholesale lending portfolio - the energy sector, developing countries, some basic industrial companies and several commercial real estate businesses. Mellon said the loan loss reserve at the end of the first quarter is estimated to be 575 mln dlrs, or about 2.5 pct of the loan book, compared with 493.8 mln dlrs or 2.17 pct of total loans at the end of 1986. Mellon said its primary capital ratio at the end of the first quarter will be in line with the end-1986 figure of 7.23 pct, well in excess of regulatory guidelines. Non-performing loans at quarter-end are estimated at 1.45 billion dlrs, or 6.5 pct of the loan portfolio, compared with 928 mln dlrs or 3.94 pct at the end of 1986. Barnes noted that Mellon has a bigger involvement in energy-based lending than many other banks. Because of the lack of a substantial recovery in energy prices this year, especially in natural gas prices, it was felt prudent to increase reserves and take losses on loans in this sector. \"This action relates both to loans to companies directly involved in energy, as well as loans to real estate developers, home builders and financial institutions in the Southwestern United States,\" Barnes said. As for LDC loans, he said Mellon had removed about 80 mln dlrs in fully current Argentine loans from cash basis but had charged off about 20 mln dlrs in private-sector Mexican debt. He said Mellon, which was ordered in December to quit Brazil because of its refusal to renew some short-term credit lines, expects to participate in efforts to helpt Brazil and other sovereign borrowers to reschedule their debts. Loans to basic industries were not major contributors to the increase in non-performing assets or to first-quarter charge offs, but Mellon said it remains concerned about the absence of a strong recovery in steel and related industries. The increase in reserves, the dividend cut and continued management cost-cutting are aimed at ensuring that Mellon has the financial strength to deal with current uncertainties, Barnes said. \"We cannot predict when the uncertainties that presently trouble us will end, but we are confident we are managing them aggressively,\" he added.

The non-transferable notes pay interest at an annual rate of 6.75 pct. The notes, which mature on March 31, 1996, became convertible into 2.3 mln shares of Lilly stock at 66.31 dlrs a share beginning March 18, 1987. Lilly said it will buy shares of stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing prices or in privately negotiated transactions. The newly announced purchase plan is in addition to its existing anti-dilutive stock repurchase programs. Under these programs, the company systematically buys back shares in the open market to replace shares issued under its stock plan and acquisition earnout agreements. Currently the only other potentially diluting instruments are the warrants that the company also issued in connection with the Hybritech acquisition. Lilly issued 17.1 mln warrants with an expiration of March 31, 1991. A warrant gives the holder the right to purchase one share of Lilly common at 75.98 dlrs. Since the acquisition, Lilly has repurchased 2.0 mln warrants, so there are currently 15.1 mln outstanding. The warrants are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Because of the theoretical size of the dilution resulting from the outstanding warrants, warrants convertible notes, stock plan and acquisition earnout agreements, the company said it will be required to report earnings per share on a fully diluted basis beginnng with the first quarter of 1987. At the end of February, Lilly had 139.6 mln shares outstanding. Reuter ',\n",

West German economics researcher Jochen Bethkenhagen, in a report presented to a NATO economics seminar, said increased targets for Soviet nuclear energy output showed the April, 1986, disaster had not caused any change in Moscow\\'s energy policy. But the accident was expected to prompt design changes in future Soviet power stations to \"exclude manipulations of safety equipment\" of the sort that occurred at Chernobyl, he said. This will presumably result in substantial delays in the completion of reactor blocks and in stricter quality controls during the construction of nuclear power stations, he said. Bethkenhagen said the Chernobyl accident was also likely to have frustrated for a long time Soviet hopes of exports of nuclear power stations to countries outside the Comecon bloc. \"It is also doubtful that the talks with China, Syria, Libya and Iraq with regard to Soviet deliveries in the next few years will have positive results,\" he said. The meeting heard views of academics and Kremlin-watchers on the impact of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on energy policy. Several participants today argued that Gorbachev was unlikely to extend his internal economic policies to the energy sector, at least for now. Bethkenhagen said high energy growth targets set by the Soviet Union up to the end of the decade showed Moscow intended to stick to a rigid supply-, rather than demand-oriented policy. Norwegian academics Arild Moe and Helge Ole Bergesen said that the Soviet fuel industries represented such a pillar of the economy that immediate reform was tricky. \"Any \\'experiment\\' on a large scale cannot be allowed, because the negative consequences if a reform backfires will be too great,\" they said.

Last month, Rotberg said that the World Bank planned to bring forward to the first half of 1987 its borrowing plans for the year because of its expectations that world interest rates will rise by the year end.

              "  'U.S. URGED TO STRENGTHEN DEBT STRATEGY\\n\\nSeveral industrial nations are pressing the United States to consider whether its debt strategy, under increasing fire in the developing world, needs to be strengthened, monetary sources say. While few nations are ready to pour vast sums of money into radical \"debt relief\" style solutions to the debt crisis, pressure is building for a greater International Monetary Fund role in the plan. But U.S. officials, who are fighting off demands for change by Congress, are confident they will retain support for their strategy which will probably be endorsed in a communique issued by the IMF\\'s policy-making Interim Committee. One Reagan administration official said a recent discussion among leading industrial countries showed there was \"very broad and strong support for continuing the strategy\". The official said in an interview, \"I don\\'t sense that there\\'s a strong desire to revise the debt strategy, except of course here on (Capitol) Hill.\" But monetary sources said some industrial nations, like France and Italy, are troubled by signs the strategy is increasingly strained. Britain too is said to be concerned. In late 1985, Washington called on multilateral development banks, like the World Bank, and commercial banks to increase loans to the 15 major debtors by 29 billion dlrs over three years. In return, the major debtors were expected to undertake reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth, more open markets and a reduced government role in the economy. The IMF was to retain a \"central role\" in the strategy, shifting its economic reform programs from emphasizing austerity to stressing growth, freer trade policies and foreign investment in debtor nations. But monetary sources said some nations want even more flexibility from the IMF when it sets economic programs tied to loans for debtor nations. Such flexibility would include less rigid economic targets -- which often lead to artificial crises when they are not met -- and more reliance on ranges and benchmarks to monitor economic performance. There is also concern that the level of IMF lending is too low and the commercial banks, themselves under attack for tawdry loan levels to debtors, want to see it increased. The IMF, which holds its semi-annual meetings with the World Bank next week, will only be a small net lender this year. Much of its loan disbursements are offset by repayments. Meanwhile, most countries, including the United States, acknowledge the banks have not lived up to their commitments. Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is particularly irritated with the reluctance of commercial banks to lend more to reforming debtors, monetary sources say. New IMF managing director Michel Camdessus is understood to be worried about the Fund\\'s image in the developing world, where it is often depicted as the source of economic ills. Camdessus\\' experience as former chairman of the so-called \"Paris Club\" of western creditor governments, has given him extensive first-hand experience of the debt crisis. Brazil, which in February declared an interest paymernts moratorium on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt, has flatly ruled out adopting a program of IMF-sponsored economic reforms. Peru too has rejected an IMF program, curbing debt repayments to 10 pct of exports. But the administration official said Brazil\\'s strategy of using a moratorium as a negotiating tool might backfire. \"It\\'s probably turning out to be more complicated than they thought. It underlines the extreme risk that a debtor country takes on itself when it begins down that road,\" the official said. Indeed, U.S. banks are laying the groundwork for writing down their Brazilian loans. U.S. officials have generally praised most debtors for adopting genuine economic reforms and the multilateral institutions for stepping up their lending. And they point out that Venezuela, Chile and the Philippines have struck agreement with commercial banks stretching out debt repayments. But problems still dog assembly of a 7.7 billion dlrs bank loan for Mexico, which many officials acknowledge may be the last major cash loan for a debtor country. Instead, banks are being pressed to come up with more novel ways of easing the liquidity squeeze in debtor nations. The prospect of greater official involvement in the debt strategy depends chiefly on the ability of western nations to come up with more finance. While there is sympathy in Congress for various forms of debt relief, more U.S. funds for the World Bank or the IMF are a virtual impossibility in today\\'s era of budget restraint. That leaves rich surplus nations like Japan and West Germany, but neither country favors generalized debt relief. And the Reagan administration is not inclined to bow to Congressional pressure for changes in regulations governing foreign loans, to make it easier for banks to account for delays in interest and principal repayments.

A spokeswoman for the EC Commission said the detailed 25-page report of alleged malpractices was in response to a similar document issued by U.S. Administration officials in November, and updated a previous EC list. EC External Trade Relations Commissioner Willy De Clercq said its object was to show such actions were not solely taken by trading partners of the U.S. And that \"the U.S. Were not innocents in the matter.\" The report covers the entire field of EC-U.S. Commercial relations and lists more than 30 obstacles ranging from tariff measures, import quotas, customs duties, anti-dumping procedures, fiscal barriers and export subsidies. The Commission said not all the barriers mentioned were necessarily inconsistent with U.S. International obligations, and emphasised many of them could be removed at upcoming international trade talks. \"The purpose of the report is to make clear that trade practices which impede exports are not a unique problem only faced by U.S. Exporters. Europeans face similar problems in the U.S.,\" it said. Among the obstacles detailed in the report are import restrictions on food products, such as cheese, sugar and syrup, certain wines, beers and juices, as well as on firearms and machine tools. It also criticises programs to boost U.S. Cereals exports. The document said the U.S.\\'s three-year export enhancement program (EEP), which began in 1985, had subsidised exports of 9.7 mln tonnes of wheat, two mln tonnes of wheat flour and 2.8 mln tonnes of barley up to mid-March this year. The subsidies granted so far were worth about 620 mln dlrs, it added. \"The Community has already reacted where necessary to U.S. EEP subsidies by increasing its exports refunds, and will continue to do so,\" it said, adding the current GATT round would also provide an opportunity to address the subject. The document also says import quotas maintained by the U.S. On a range of farm products, including sugar, peanuts and certain cottons, restrict EC exports. In addition, the report deplores a recent U.S.-Japan accord on semi-conductors, export controls on technology transfers, standards tests in the telecommunications arena and the U.S. Administration\\'s \"buy American\" public procurement policy.

Lyng said he and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, during a visit to Japan later this month, will demand \"total elimination\" of the beef import quota by April 1988. The current dispute with Japan over semiconductor may strengthen the U.S. stance in farm trade negotiations, Lyng said, because Japan does not want a trade war with the U.S. Lyng dismissed recent statements in Tokyo that Japan might retaliate against U.S. products as a result of the semiconductor dispute. \"They (Japan) aren\\'t going to pick a fight with us,\" Lyng said, adding that with its huge bilateral trade surplus Japan has more to lose in a trade war than the United States. Lyng told the U.S. cattlemen that the quota on Japanese beef imports does not allow consumers there an adequate choice in food purchases. He said in addition to beef, the U.S. will press for eliminiation of import barriers on Japan\\'s citrus and rice as well.

The bond redemptions are the first in the public market and may be followed by similar moves in other capital markets if the Bank considers the exercise financially beneficial and consistent with its overall funding strategy. Rotberg noted that the World Bank is very liquid right now, with some 18 billion dlrs in cash available. The Bank will be looking at various instruments and the levels they are trading at in determining what issues will be repaid, he said. However, Rotberg said that unlike the yen loans, there was no immediate plan to refinance the Swiss franc bonds, although the Bank could possibly issue new debt in that market over the next few months. He said that the yen loans, which were the equivalent of some three billion dlrs principal amount, had been from the Japanese long-term credit banks, trust banks and insurance companies and had interest rates of between seven and nine pct. All the borrowings were refinanced as traditional syndicated loans with the same parities at the Japanese long-term prime rate, currently 5.8 pct. The World Bank borrows in excess of 10 billion dlrs a year, with almost all its borrowings in medium and long-term fixed rate markets. Rotberg declined to say whether the 1/4 point rise in U.S. Prime rates yesterday to 7-3/4 pct signalled a reversal in the trend in interest rates. \"Over the short term, rates could go up or they could go down,\" he said, adding that the bank takes a longer view on interest rates when deciding its financing strategy. However, given the current level of interest rates, it would not be wise to take short-term money on to the liability side of the Bank\\'s balance sheet, he said. REUTER ',\n",

              "  'SUNSHINE MINING CHIEF SEES SILVER AT 9.00 DLRS\\n\\nHeightened concern over renewed inflation is feeding the rally in silver and the upward move could drive the inflation hedge metal this year to as much as 9.00 dlrs per troy ounce, Mike Boswell chairman of Sunshine Mining Co told Reuters in an interview. \"The anticipated higher inflation is being manifested in silver rather than in gold which is the traditional choice of inflation hedgers,\" said Boswell. The strength could put silver in a range of \"8.00 to 9.00 dlrs even without any material swings in supply/demand,\" Boswell said. The buying interest for silver on the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) continued strong, with prices rising today to a September 1986 high of 6.465 dlrs per ounce. However gold lagged at 426.30 dlrs, the strongest price since late January this year. Boswell said silver has been \"under-valued for so long relative to gold but it\\'s closing up the price gap.\" He noted that silver last year held at the depressed level of 5.00 dlrs while gold was soaring to more than 400.00 dlrs on concern over the heated political unrest in South Africa. \"The strength was not filtering down to silver last year. Now we\\'re seeing a delayed reaction,\" the Sunshine Mining official said. Almost a year ago, U.S. producers shut down two of their largest silver properties, Sunshine and Hecla mining companies, both located in Idaho. Boswell estimated that the closings slashed U.S. silver production by 10 mln ounces last year to less than 40 mln ounces. \"Low silver prices and high labor costs made it uneconomical to keep the mines opened,\" he said. Increased imports from Mexico and Peru have made up for the loss of production in the United States which consumes 160 to 170 mln ounces annually, Boswell said. Reuter ',\n",
              "  'BELGIUM TO SIMPLIFY BOURSE TAX SYSTEM\\n\\nBelgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens said he will announce measures in the next few days making it easier for non-residents to recoup the 25 pct withholding tax levied on investment income in Belgium. In an interview with Reuters, Eyskens also said he hoped the cabinet would tomorrow approve the abolition of bourse transaction taxes for non-residents, making Brussels one of the few stock exchanges in the world where foreign investors were not subjected to such a tax. He said both measures were aimed at attracting capital imports, reducing Belgium\\'s heavy net capital outflows. Under the present system, non-residents pay withholding tax on their income from Belgian investments and can then reclaim it from Belgian authorities. But financial analysts said the procedure for recouping the tax is so bureaucratic and slow that it effectively acts as a barrier to foreign investment in Belgium, especially in the secondary bond market. Eyskens said he was ready to \"simplify and eventually suppress\" the procedure for non-residents and would announce details in the next few days. Financial analysts said the move would be far more significant than the imminent abolition for non-residents of the minimal bourse transaction taxes. These are set at three rates - 0.07 pct, 0.14 pct and 0.35 pct - according to the type of paper transacted. Eyskens said he hoped later to be able to abolish the transaction taxes for residents as well, but this would depend on progress in cutting the government\\'s high budget deficit. He called the current 25 pct level of witholding tax \"much too high\" and said he hoped to reduce it in the longer term, perhaps as part of an overall reform of Belgian tax. But he added this would have to be done progressively because of its budgetary impact. The tax raises 170 billion francs a year in revenues, he said. Eyskens envisaged a cut to a basic 15 pct, after which a rate could be set for each new security issued. He said that as well as aggravating net capital outflows, the high rate of withholding tax also meant the treasury was forced to borrow at higher interest rates. But he said it was politically impossible to reduce taxes on investment income before those on earned income had been cut as part of the tax reform, planned for late 1980s. REUTER ',\n",

Also examined will be performance indicators for each country. The Paris accord set objectives for such sectors as growth, inflation, current account and trade balances, budget performances, monetary conditions and exchange rates. Lawson said \"At both the G-7 and the Interim Committee we will undoubtedly be discussing the debt problem. Clearly the debt problem is still with us, and still with us in quite a big way.\" \"In many ways the problems of the big debtor countries, and indeed the poorest countries, are every bit as acute as they were when they began. It will be with us for a very long time.\" Lawson said he knew of no new debt initiative which might be presented and discussed next week in Washington. \"We\\'ve got to go on a case-by-case basis,\" Lawson said. Possibilities for a coordinated approach to the problem would be something he would raise within the IMF, Lawson said. He noted the rise this week in U.S. Short-term interest rates, and said that a significant rise in borrowing costs would make the debt problem more acute. Special attention would go to Brazil next week, but Lawson added, \"I do not expect anything to come to a head on that.\" Lawson said he told Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro here in February that Britain would not intervene and press British commercial banks into giving Brazil easier borrowing conditions. \"I told him it was a matter for the banks, not governments,\" Lawson said.

The rate rise would underpin economic and financial policy convergence among major countries, he added. In an interview with Reuters, Eyskens also made clear he believed the countries involved in the accord - the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada - had agreed \"tentative\" fluctuation ranges for exchange rates. Eyskens was speaking before hosting an informal meeting of European Community finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Belgium this weekend focusing on the international monetary situation and proposals for strengthening the European Monetary System (EMS). Asked about the dollar\\'s recent fall on currency markets, Eyskens said he believed the Paris agreement was proving \"more or less workable\" despite what he called evident disagreements over U.S. Economic and monetary policy between Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Besides Baker\\'s public statements that had dramatically influenced exchange markets, trade tensions between the U.S.And Japan had also caused the dollar\\'s fall, expecially against the yen, he said. But he expressed optimism that Washington and Tokyo could reach a compromise in their row over semi-conductor trade. \"I think agreement is quite possible,\" he said. Eyskens said he was \"very agreeably surprised\" by this week\\'s quarter-point increase in U.S. Prime rates despite the obvious negative consequences for debtor countries. \"It is a positive element which goes further than the (Paris) Louvre agreement ...It is the market taking account of its content,\" he said. He added that coordination of interest rates was a fundamental element of economic and monetary convergence between leading industrialised economies. \"A policy of maintaining exchange rates within fluctuation ranges is not possible if it is not accompanied at least by a more coordinated policy of interest rates,\" he said. Eyskens made clear he believed the G-6 countries had agreed in Paris on ranges in which to hold their currencies. He said the end of the February 22 Louvre accord, in which the partners agreed to cooperate closely to foster exchange rate stability around current levels, clearly alluded to a \"system of tentative (fluctuation) margins.\" He added the meeting and the statement would have been meaningless if the G-6 had not discussed the technicalities of implementing it. Eyskens said there was growing economic convergence among leading industrialised countries pointing towards greater order in the international monetary system. \"That doesn\\'t mean we are ready to restore Bretton Woods (the post-World War Two system of fixed exchange rates), but within the (International Monetary Fund) Interim Committee we are thinking in terms of target zones, fluctuation ranges to be implemented and defended,\" he said.

He said he hoped for wide-ranging talks on the future of the EMS at the weekend meeting, based on proposals from the EC\\'s Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors for strengthening the system through technical and institutional changes.

The marginal rate set at today's auction, from which reporters were barred for the first time since the sessions began last September, was 3.7001 to the dollar compared with 4.0002 at the last session on March 19, the sources said. Under the new system unveiled on March 20 and in operation for the first time today, bidding banks must pay for foreign exchange at the rate they bid, rather than as previously at the rate of the lowest successful bid. The measure was aimed at discouraging banks from bidding high and thus driving down the naira's value.

Henceforth the sessions will be held every fortnight, instead of weekly, and today only 80 mln dlrs was on offer compared with the 50 mln dlrs usually on sale each week.

Robusta coffee futures dipped sharply to 4-1/2 year lows yesterday at 1,220 stg per tonne, basis the May position, when the lack of new debate on quotas at ICO talks here confirmed expectations that efforts to restore quotas would not be revived at this stage, they said. The 15-day ICO average composite price fell to 99.69 cents a lb for April 1, the lowest for 5-1/2 years. Quotas will not now be renegotiated before the ICO\\'s annual September council session, and in the interim the Brazilian frost season from June to August may prove the only bullish factor to stem further price weakness, they said. Futures bounced back from the lows today towards the previous trading range around 1,260/1,270 stg per tonne on May as the market recovered from yesterday\\'s \"confidence blip,\" one trader commented. But despite today\\'s upturn, the overall trend is for lower prices in the near future, one trade source said. The market had become increasingly vulnerable to yesterday\\'s shakeout, having held within a 1,250/1,350 stg second position trading range for 22 successive sessions, he said. Technically the market is more likely to decline further as it absorbs today\\'s brief rally. Steep declines towards the 1,100/1,050 stg area could foster a \"three figure mentality,\" and speculators may elect to push for coffee prices below the psychological 1,000 stg level, he added. Some traders said today\\'s upturn was in part due to Brazil\\'s opening last night of May green coffee export registrations. This had been widely anticipated by the market and came as no surprise, but it did remove some prevailing uncertainty and light trade buying was seen this morning as a consequence. However, the overall trend remains downwards and a test of support at 1,200 stg should be expected soon, with the only possible supportive influence on the horizon being the approach of Brazil\\'s frost season, they said. Roasters are believed to be well covered, limiting activities to modest hand-to-mouth purchases and generally not taking up producer offers, they added. Central American producers have sold the bulk of their current crops, but robusta producers in West Africa and Indonesia need to sell coffee for April through July shipment, and this could pressure prices further, traders said. However, one dealer, although seeing no reason to be bullish, advised caution. \"Everybody\\'s bearish now, just as they were bullish when the market was at 3,100 stg,\" he said. Arthur Cherry, coffee analyst at E.D. and F. Man, expressed doubts the price spiral would continue much below current levels. \"One dlr coffee is catastrophic for many producers -- there must be a minimum below which prices cannot fall.\" While prices dropped to the lowest levels since September 1982 yesterday, manufacturers have no plans to cut their retail prices. \"Its impossible to say, we can\\'t predict anything like that at this stage,\" a General Foods spokesman said. Manufacturers have lowered prices recently anyway in response to market weakness. At the beginning of March the price of a 100 gram jar of coffee was cut to 1.55 stg from 1.65 stg in Britain. But should coffee market prices continue to fall, the situation would be reviewed, the spokesman added. Nestle also has no plans to make additional price cuts in the near future. \"The market seems to have established some equilibrium and doesn\\'t look set to go much lower,\" a Nestle spokesman commented. Coffee\\'s plunge this week has been mirrored by tea, which fell to a 5-1/2 year low at today\\'s auction at 1.18 stg per kilo for medium quality, traders added. Reuter ',\n",

Tensions have been running high between Brazil and its bank creditors since President Jose Sarney imposed a unilateral suspension of interest payments on some 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt on February 20, bankers said. Only yesterday, three leading U.S. banks voluntarily put their Brazilian loans on non-accrual status and took a hefty cut in net income for the first quarter ended March 31. Bankers saw this as a clear refusal to be intimidated into granting major concessions as forthcoming refinancing talks. Bank of Montreal\\'s Mulholland regretted Brazil\\'s action but declined to discuss what action his bank might take. Mulholland merely said that Bank of Montreal had not canceled any of its short-term credit lines that came up for renewal on March 31. However, John Bradlow, senior vice president of the corporate and goverment banking division, said that it was possible that Bank of Montreal might follow the U.S. banks\\' lead in its second quarter results accounting. \"A decision will be made at April 30 or in the first weeks of May,\" he told reporters after the briefing. Unlike most major U.S. banks, whose reporting year ends on December 31, Canadian banks operate on a November through October basis. At the press briefing, Mulholland detailed the proposed debt/equity conversion scheme, which is aimed at boosting investment capital and conserving foreign exchange reserves. Unlike many existing programs, Bank of Montreal intends to sell its own dollar-denominated debt at par to either the obligor or local investors for cruzados, which would then be ploughed into Brazilian assets. Mulholland said current debt/equity schemes, in which bank debt is often sold to foreign third parties at a discount, were like \"peddling off debt at fire sale prices\". He added that they could do pyschological harm to investor confidence. While acknowledging that Brazil has yet to give its official blessing to the plan, Mulholland predicted, \"if it is supported, we are going to see more of this.\" Sources at other large banks with sizeable exposure to Brazil were not so sure about the scheme\\'s success. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s going to fly because of the impact it would have on money supply and other political reasons,\" said one banker, noting that earlier informal proposals along the same lines received \"fairly neutral responses.\" \"And is there a market for such investment in a time of great uncertainty,\" he added. Mulholland admitted, \"it is something of an experiment.... some one has to screw up the courage and do something.\" \"It is very important that avenues (to reversing net capital outflows) are broadened,\" he added, noting that in recent years the options have in fact been narrowing. Another senior banker agreed that debt/equity swap proposals, such as Bank of Montreal\\'s, should be explored and developed but warned that Brasilia has been \"very ambivalent\" about debt/equity schemes thus far. The banker added, \"debt/equity conversion should happen but it is not a major instrument for solving debt problems.\" Reuter ',\n",

              "  'STERLING REBOUNDS ON LAWSON \"TARGET\"-DENIAL\\n\\nSterling made a sharp recovery when U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson described remarks he made yesterday on targets for the pound as \"insignificant,\" rallying back up almost exactly to the levels it had fetched before Lawson spoke yesterday, dealers and analysts said. They said sterling would likely leave the limelight once again to trade quietly around current levels, as the markets set their sights on the dollar, yen and mark again ahead of key international monetary talks in Washington next week. Sterling ended its European day at 1.6020/30 dlrs, virtually unchanged from yesterday\\'s last 1.6040/50 dlrs, fetched before Lawson\\'s first comment. But it was well up on levels just above 1.59 dlrs which it had held until the second comment came. Against the mark, sterling recovered to close at 2.9190/9240 marks after today\\'s opening 2.9040/90 and last night\\'s 2.9210/45. \"On balance, it is as if nothing happened ... We are back to where we were before,\" Mark Brett, economist at securities house Barclays de Zoete Wedd said. \"This whole story is like a storm in a teacup,\" a dealer with a U.K. Bank commented. The pound\\'s recovery was triggered when Lawson criticised media coverage of comments he made yesterday, when he told a conference he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was. In this context, Lawson was reported to have specified rates of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs to the pound in remarks which markets were quick to interpret as a signal to sell sterling. Lawson said today he had merely stated yesterday\\'s approximate value of the pound. \"The wrong end of the stick was picked up,\" he told reporters, adding his comments did in no way signal a change in British exchange rate policies. Dealers and analysts said the reactions to both statements were clear evidence that the market, frustrated by the relative currency stability after the February 22 Paris agreement, was desperate to reactivate trading and would react to any clues offered about the contents of the currency accord. In Paris, finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada are widely believed to have agreed exchange rate targets, although no participant has specified these in an apparent bid to foster stability by keeping markets guessing. \"The markets are absolutely desperate to get clues on Group of Six (countries that are part to the Paris agreement) targets ... The number of rumours flying around is bigger than ever before,\" said Barclays de Zoete Wedd\\'s Brett. Analysts said neither yesterday\\'s remarks nor today\\'s had changed their impression that after Paris, sterling was targeted to trade in broad ranges against major currencies. All polled analysts said if anything, the 2.90 marks level mentioned by Lawson was probably the centre of a wide 20-pfennig range which sterling would easily hold, helped by good economic indicators and relatively high interest rates. \"It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election ... I don\\'t believe Lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate,\" Brett said. He expected sterling to firm over the next few weeks, to around 2.95 marks and 1.63 dlrs, as overseas investors reappraised high-yielding investments here. Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Securities, said he was not surprised to see Lawson qualify his sterling target comments so quickly. \"His remarks gave markets a target to aim at,\" he said, adding, \"He (Lawson) talked himself into a bit of a corner on this ... It made him a hostage to fortune.\" Marshall and other analysts dismissed a theory, that by quoting target rates Lawson had attempted to put pressure on prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to agree to British membership of the European Monetary System (EMS), as implausible.

Speaking to reporters after a security analyst meeting, he said the gain was expected because of higher oil and gas prices, but declined to compare his expectations with the 331 mln dlrs, or 1.28 dlrs per share, the company earned in 1986\\'s first quarter. Earlier, Morrow told the analysts that Amoco\\'s first quarter refining and marketing results \"will look pretty poor,\" because of low margins in January and February. The margins began to improve last month and look pretty good now, he added. Morrow said he expects oil product margins to remain good for the rest of the year, \"but it remains to be seen if they will match 1986 levels.\" The Amoco chairman said he expects crude oil prices to remain in the 17 to 20 dlr barrel range for the rest of 1988 based on his belief that OPEC\\'s agreement will hold. Morrow said his best estimate for 1989 crude oil prices is 21 dlrs per barrel, adding he believes this price level would result in a 40 pct increase in oil company exploration spending. President H. Lawrance Fuller told the analysts Amoco reduced its estimates of worldwide oil and gas reserves by a total of 201 mln equivalent barrels last year because of a drop in oil and gas prices. Noting the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that reserves be estimated on the assumption that year-end prices will remain fixed for the life of the properties, he said the drop in oil prices to 16 dlrs a barrel at the end of 1986 from 27 dlrs a year earlier forced the company to reduce its reserve estimate by four pct. Fuller said Amoco expects its U.S. oil and natural gas liquids production to decline about five pct this year from last year\\'s 121 mln barrels because of drilling deferrals made last year when oil prices were falling. He said the full impact of the deferrals was off-set by the purchase of properties which will add about 5,000 barrels per day to the company\\'s 1987 U.S. production. Fuller said U.S. refining capacity is expected to be increasingly strained by the rising demand for lead-free gasoline, especially the higher octane grades. He said expected federal regulations on gasoline vapor pressure will further tighten the industry\\'s gasoline production capacity. Reuter ',\n",

Speaking to the New York Financial Writers\\' Association, Maxwell said he viewed this week\\'s rise in U.S. banks\\' prime rates to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 pct as a temporary phenomenon. \"I don\\'t see a substantial rise in rates this year. If anything, the Federal Reserve is more likely to ease than to tighten (monetary policy) because so many sectors of the economy are showing weakness,\" Maxwell said. Fannie Mae buys mortgages from lenders and issues mortgage-backed securities. Maxwell said restructuring of Fannie Mae over the last two years had limited its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. A one pct rise in rates in 1987 would cost shareholders about 18 cts a share versus one dlr a share in 1981, he said. Maxwell also questioned the view that housing crowds out other sectors of the economy from obtaining needed capital. \"There\\'s no evidence that housing is crowding firms out of the long-term debt market,\" he said.

              "  'GOURMET COFFEE MAKES U.S. SUPERMARKET DEBUT\\n\\nShoppers who buy Haagen-Daas ice cream, Dijon mustard or Tuborg beer on their weekly trip to the supermarket are soon to be the target of a promotional blitz for national-brand \"gourmet\" coffees. General Foods, the largest U.S. coffee roaster, and A and P, which shares the third place in the U.S. market, are the only two national brand roasters so far to introduce the higher-quality coffees into selected supermarkets. But industry insiders believe there is substantial growth potential in upscale coffee, despite years of flat sales in regular ground roast types. \"I would suspect General Foods will make a name for themselves with their gourmet line,\" said a coffee trade source. \"What it could do is really dent the small-store, whole-bean business,\" the trade source added. The new lines are designed to appeal to a classic advertising composite--the \"yuppie\" consumer. They buy fresh pasta, subscribe to Bon Appetit magazine and were \"first on their block with a wok,\" as described by Karin Brown, General Foods senior product manager for its new coffee, called Private Collection out of GF\\'s Maxwell House division. Paul Gallant, president of A and P\\'s Compass Foods subsidiary that makes the new A and P gourmet line, described its potential appeal as \"a status thing.\" At an initial price of 4.99 dlrs for 12 ounces it is expensive, though not more so than high quality coffee sold in small specialty stores. General Foods\\' Maxwell House Div. has just cut the price on its new offering by 50 cents to 4.49 dlrs for 12 ounces--a move competitor A and P is bound to imitate, according to an A and P executive. Number two U.S. roaster Folgers has \"nothing to announce at this point\" in the gourmet line, a spokesman said. Neither does Hills Bros., a subsidiary of Nestle that shares the third and fourth size market spot by volume with A and P. Competitors believe Folgers will watch the progress of General Foods\\' offering, prepared to jump in if the market takes off. General Foods and A and P hope their new products will help push coffee sales out of the doldrums. Coffee consumption in the United States has fallen 44 pct since 1962, according to a 1986 study by the International Coffee Organization. Sales show no signs of picking up. Compass\\'s Gallant blames the falloff on declines in coffee quality since the 1960\\'s and aggressive soft drink marketing. \"The national brands began to cheapen the blend in the name of profit but spent 100 mln dlrs a year telling consumers this was quality coffee,\" Gallant said. As a result, first time consumers never got a taste for the brew. The first time a young consumer tries coffee, \"they turn around and say \\'My God this is awful, I think I\\'ll have a Coke\\',\" he said. Having now mostly written off the 16-25 age group, who have confirmed their loyalty to soft drinks, coffee marketers are aiming at the high income, free-spending, self-treating crowd -- the yuppie composite. \"Where else are you going to go?,\" an industry source said. \"Kids aren\\'t going to drink coffee, that\\'s apparent. There are no other markets. The only area that\\'s not been promoted is gourmet,\" he said. In addition to perking up sales, success in the gourmet line could provide much higher margins to roasters than regular ground roast coffees produce. Generally, retail prices are about twice the price of green, unroasted coffee beans, taking into account the costs of roasting, packaging and distribution, and then deducting often-generous trade discounts. Supermarkets tend to sell coffee near the trade price as a \"loss leader,\" a product designed to draw shoppers into the store. But with the new gourmet lines, a different pricing structure prevails, industry sources said. There is no trade discounting and an emphasis on expensive packaging, including a special valve designed to keep the beans fresher. Dealers said roasters were buying the higher quality green beans at about 1.60 dlrs a lb. Thus, retail prices on gourmet coffee are now almost three times the price of green. Targetted consumers seem willing to pay the difference. General Foods claims 80 pct of consumers in their test market surveys for Private Collection came back for more. And product manager Brown points to the success of more expensive beers, mustard and ice cream, that began selling in restricted high income areas and are now available in almost every supermarket in the country. A and P is similarly optimistic. \"We think we\\'ll do extremely well in the gourmet market,\" Gallant said. Maxwell House is marketing its eight types of Private Collection in selected high income areas, while A and P offers its 14 different whole bean gourmet coffees, called 8 O\\'Clock Royale, only in their own stores in Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York, Atlanta and some other metropolitan areas.

              "  'U.S. ACREAGE CUTS SEEN LIMITING STOCK BUILD\\n\\nSharp cuts this year in U.S. planted acreage may not make a big dent in the U.S. grain stockpile but will at least keep grain surpluses from increasing, Agriculture Department and industry commodity analysts said. \"The scenario is turning around on stocks. The whole supply/demand picture could finally be getting more in balance,\" a USDA analyst said. The USDA prospective plantings report this week indicated that U.S. farmers will idle 52 to 55 mln acres in annual acreage reduction programs this year. An additional 20 mln acres have been enrolled in the conservation reserve program, bringing total idled acreage in the U.S. to 72-75 mln acres, almost a third of the nation\\'s total 235 mln acre crop base. Production of wheat, corn and soybeans in 1986/87 will probably closely match annual usage, limiting any buildup in stocks, analysts said. \"It\\'s a substantially different story from last year when we added 1.5 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile,\" Vernon McMinimy, director of commodity research for Staley Co. said. Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here, McMinimy said that 67.6 mln planted acres of corn will likely translate into 60 mln harvested acres, and with normal yields, final production of 6.9 to 7.0 billion bushels. McMinimy estimated that total U.S. corn disappearance in 1986/87 could end up at 7.1 billion bushels, possibly resulting in a 200-million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpile of 5.45 billion bushels. \"To say this represents a turn-around is wrong, but we\\'re at least in a holding pattern,\" George Hoffman, director of commodity analysis for Pillsbury said. Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of 1986/87 to 1.9 billion bushels due to \"significantly less\" domestic feed use for wheat because of lower corn prices. USDA analysts, however, project slightly higher usage and said wheat stocks will either decrease slightly or at least not increase. With yearly use at around two billion bushels, next year\\'s projected crop could be used up, an analyst said. \"We won\\'t be adding to stocks. Stocks are at a record now, so if we can begin to touch them even minutely through acreage reductions, that would be an improvement,\" an Agriculture Department wheat analyst said. Soybean planted acreage, at 56.9 mln acres, would be the smallest planted soybean acreage since 1976 and could lower final production by 150 mln bushels and ending stocks by 50 to 100 mln bushels, analysts said. As more marginal, erodable acreage is enrolled in the conservation reserve program, annual acreage reduction programs will be more effective because they will force more high producing land out of production, a USDA analyst said. \"We can now maybe see the light at the end of a very long tunnel,\" the analyst said.

              "  'JAPANESE BANKS EXPAND HONG KONG PRESENCE\\n\\nAt a time when Britain is threatening to revoke the license of Japanese banks in retaliation for restrictive trade practices, Hong Kong is rolling out the welcome mat to Japan. The British colony last week issued a banking licence to the Bank of Fukuoka Ltd, making it the 24th Japanese bank here. Japan has the largest banking contingent in Hong Kong, followed by the U.S. With 22 banks. Eleven Japanese banks have representative offices here and Japanese institutions operate 34 deposit-taking companies (DTCs). Assistant banking commissioner K.K Wong told Reuters: \"There are no special favours towards the Japanese...But because of Japan\\'s strong economy and currency, they easily meet our requirement on assets (14 billion U.S. Dlrs).\" The Japanese control the largest share of assets of the financial institutions here but incorporated elsewhere, with 980.5 billion H.K. Dlrs at end-1986, or 57.5 pct of the total. \"Hong Kong authorities welcome Japanese banks,\" said Haruo Kimura, assistant general manager of the Bank of Tokyo. \"But the U.S. And Britain are unhappy with the slow liberalisation of the Tokyo financial market.\" Japanese bankers said Hong Kong offers good business opportunities, especially in China trade, to Japanese banks who are following their clients\\' international expansion. \"As their clients become more international, they have to keep up and follow them,\" said Yutaka Toda, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank\\'s general manager here. \"We can have access to local traders and regional corporations,\" said Bank of Tokyo\\'s Kimura. \"We can also pick up business with China.\" Bankers said more Japanese banks are on the way. An influx of Japanese banks began in the late 1970s when the government lifted a moratorium on new licences. But newcomers are allowed one branch each and only the Bank of Tokyo, Sanwa Bank and Sumitomo Bank have more than one branch. Because of this limitation, Japanese banks have mostly concentrated on wholesale business. \"It is very difficult to compete with those giants such as the Hongkong Bank and the Bank of China,\" said Kimura of the Bank of Tokyo. Bank of Tokyo has the largest Japanese bank network here with seven branches, while Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp and the Bank of China groups each have hundreds of branches. To broaden their client and deposit base, some Japanese banks have taken equity in local banks. The latest such move was Dai-Ichi Kangyo\\'s increase of its stake in Chekiang First Bank last year to 95 pct from 33 pct. Tokai Bank, Fuji Bank and Mitsubishi Bank also have interests in small local banks. But Mitsubishi, not content with its single-branch licence and a 25 pct stake in the small Liu Chong Hing Bank, bought Mercantile Bank Ltd\\'s multi-branch licence early this year. \"We will open one more branch in (Hong Kong\\'s district of) Kowloon soon, to better serve our clients on the other side of the harbour,\" said Mitsubishi Bank general manager Takeshi Tange. Their weakness in the retail market forces Japanese banks to rely on the interbank market for funding. Government data show that despite their large share of total assets, Japanese banks had only 54.4 billion dlrs in deposits at end-1986, or 17.1 pct of deposits of banks in Hong Kong incorporated elsewhere. \"Most Japanese banks\\' international lendings in the region are booked in Hong Kong,\" said a Japanese banker who declined to be named. He said it is mainly for tax reasons, adding that assets such as loans booked in Hong Kong are not subject to Japanese tax. Japanese banks are barred by the Tokyo government from issuing Eurobonds, but their Hong Kong subsidiaries can tap the Euromarket and lend the funds to the parent. Bankers said this role could be undermined by a five pct capital adequacy ratio that goes into effect next year, requiring many DTC\\'s to increase their capital. Many Japanese banks are seeking special treatment for their largely offshore operations or a different risk calculation for their assets. \"I don\\'t think this will stop them from coming here,\" said a banker. \"But it may mean they have to conduct some of their offshore funding operations elsewhere.\" REUTER ',\n",

              "  'CHINA CURTAILS KEY REFORM GOAL OF REALISTIC PRICES\\n\\nFear of social instability and inflation has forced China to curtail a major economic reform -- overhauling a pricing system in which prices bear no relation to production costs. Despite pledges last year that price changes were needed to get the economy on the right track, Peking has repeatedly said no major change will happen this year. The backtracking has occurred during a conservative backlash following the resignation in January of reformist Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang, western diplomats and Chinese sources say. \"Price changes in the last two years have aroused great public discontent, especially in the cities,\" one western diplomat said. \"Chinese were used to stable prices for 30 years from 1949 when the communists took over. On a recent visit to two major cities, the refrain from all the officials was the need to preserve social stability.\" A Chinese journalist said the reformers under-estimated the potential public resistance to price increases. \"A major review of all economic reforms is under way, the biggest since the reforms began in 1979, because many things are not going well -- a large budget deficit, too rapid price increases and no major improvement in productivity of state firms,\" the Chinese journalist said. This view was reflected by the official People\\'s Daily in a major article this week. The daily said price increases had been taking place too quickly in recent years. \"In future, price changes should be only in small steps,\" it said, adding that wage increases and lax monetary policies had resulted in too much money chasing too few goods. The Chinese journalist said the review was in part due to political factors. \"Economics and politics are inseparable in China. But the western media are wrong to classify the leadership into reformers and conservatives. All the leaders agree on the main direction -- economic reform and the open-door,\" he said. \"But there are differences of opinion on the pace of reform and on specific policies. No one is advocating a return to how things were before 1979.\" Those who say prices should reflect production costs believe the issue is vital to China\\'s economy. Sugar is an example. An official newspaper said earlier this year that over 40 pct of the country\\'s sugar mills were losing money, or had closed because the price of sugar had not changed for 20 years, while the production costs have risen sharply over the same period. The western diplomat said Chinese leaders did not fear a backlash against rising prices would result in rioting in the streets, which they had the means to control. \"The bottom line is how such protests would be used by those in the power struggle (inside the Communist Party),\" he said. Said a foreign lawyer, referring to the crisis sparked by student demonstrations which led to Hu\\'s replacement, \"The leadership here is a self-perpetuating oligarchy. There is no way that it is going to give up power.\" The Chinese journalist added that China appears to have reached a crossroads. \"There is no clear proposal as to what to do next,\" he said. \"Premier Zhao (Ziyang) has instructed his think-tanks to come up with how to continue the reforms in 1988.\" But for the time being at least, the path leading to price reforms is out of favour.

Broking house officials in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo yesterday told Reuters Pakistan had suspended the licences in order to link tea imports to Pakistani exports. The latest available figures show that Kenyan exports to Pakistan, mainly tea, were worth 75 mln dlrs in 1985, while imports from Pakistan amounted to only 4.8 mln dlrs. Kenya provides over 50 pct of Pakistan\\'s tea imports.

The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31 said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks will help prepare Japan to improve access. Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an easing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports which stressed the need for strict controls on some products to maintain self-sufficiency in food. Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs, down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show. The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances. The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly responsible for higher domestic prices, it said. The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has worsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the paper said. This could make it difficult to improve the industry's structure, the paper said. To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices to more reasonable levels, Japan should try to restructure the the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it self-supporting, it said.

              "  \"ROTTERDAM'S MAIN GRAIN TERMINAL CLOSED BY STRIKE\\n\\nGrain handling at Rotterdam port's main grain terminal was at a standstill today as members of the largest Dutch transport union FNV staged a lightning strike for the third day running. Pieter van der Vorm, managing director of Graan Elevator Mij (GEM), which handles 95 pct of grain passing through the port, said their main Europoort terminal was out of action because of a strike by technical staff. The actions, in support of union demands in negotiations over a new labour agreement, began on Wednesday when grain handlers stopped work. Van der Vorm said that if strikes continued on today's scale for some time vessels coming to unload grain in Rotterdam would face delays, but this was not happening yet. Wednesday's actions left GEM's facilities 40 pct operational, and there were only limited strikes yesterday. Talks between unions and employers yesterday and today produced no result, but FNV spokesman Bert Duim said the union was prepared to put their key demand, for a 36 hour working week, at the bottom of the agenda. Van der Vorm said, however, the union's demands on a range of issues were far in excess of the management's final offer. REUTER \",\n",

              "  'SOUTH KOREA TO PAY MORE FOR JAPANESE ETHYLENE\\n\\nSouth Korea will pay about 20 pct more for ethylene imported from Japan in the second quarter of the year because increased plastic production in both countries has boosted demand and tightened supplies, chemical industry sources said. South Korea has agreed to pay Japanese trading houses just over 400 dlrs C and F per tonne, up from an average of 350 dlrs in the first quarter and throughout 1986, they said. South Korean demand for imported ethylene this month has risen to 17,000 tonnes from 10,000 last month, and the country may face difficulties covering the extra volume, they said. <Korea Petrochemical Industries Corp>, a producer of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene, will more than double its ethylene requirements to 9,000 tonnes a month from 4,000 when it completes a plant expansion at the end of this month, the sources said. <Honan Ethylene Corp\\'s> import requirements have risen to 8,000 tonnes a month from 6,000 tonnes last year to meet strong demand from <Honan Petrochemical Co>, which makes HDPE and ethylene glycol, and <Hangyang Chemical>, which produces low-density polyethylene and vinyl chloride monomer, they said. But Japan\\'s ethylene plants are already operating at almost full capacity of 4.5 mln tonnes a year just to fulfill domestic demand, the sources said. \"And even if Japan had the additional ethylene, there is a logistical problem of finding extra appropriate-sized vessels to ship it to Korea,\" said one trading house source. Japanese trading companies are looking to alternative sources to supply South Korea\\'s needs, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Mexico, they said. But long-haul voyages are expensive as the product has to be shipped at a temperature of minus 103 degrees centigrade to keep it in a liquid form, they said. Japan has no plans to invest further in the ethylene industry in order to cope with the additional demand, despite rising prices, trading house sources said. South Korea has two projects in hand which will increase its ethylene production capacity by 500,000 tonnes a year by the end of 1989, so the strong demand surge for imports is only a medium-term trend, they said.

              "  'SWISS 1988 INFLATION SEEN AT TWO PCT - INSTITUTE\\n\\nSwiss inflation is likely to rise in 1987 and 1988 because of inflationary tendencies in the domestic economy, the Centre for Economic Research of the Federal Institute of Technology said in its spring review. It forecast a rise in consumer prices of two pct in 1988 compared with 1.3 pct in 1987. Low import prices in 1986 helped to keep annual inflation down to 0.8 pct. The centre said that in general the outlook for the Swiss economy in 1987 and 1988 remained favourable, despite the more difficult international economic climate facing export industry. The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth in Swiss domestic product would slow to 2.2 pct in 1987 from 2.5 pct in 1986. It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 1.7 pct from 1.6 pct in its last autumn review. Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as the motor of economic growth. Private consumption will grow by three pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 3.75 pct in 1986. Growth in goods exports will slow to 1.75 pct in 1987 from 2.1 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 2.5 pct in 1988. All three figures are well below the Swiss average for recent years. In 1985, for example, exports increased by 9.1 pct. The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc, which has firmed sharply in recent months, would continue to put pressure on Swiss exporters. It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a more modest 4.5 pct in 1987 and 3.25 pct in 1988 than in 1986, when import prices fell substantially and imports rose by 8.2 pct. Industrial production will grow by 1.6 pct in 1987 and 1.2 pct in 1988 compared with 4.2 pct in 1986. REUTER ',\n",

              "  'REAGAN\\'S STRENGTH IN U.S. CONGRESS APPEARS SAPPED\\n\\nPresident Reagan\\'s reduced strength in Congress has been demonstrated by the U.S. Senate\\'s decision to approve a highway spending bill despite his attempts to veto it, political analysts said. \"He\\'s very weakened,\" said William Schneider of the private American Enterprise public policy group after the Senate voted 67-33 yesterday to ignore Reagan\\'s veto of the road bill. Schneider contrasted Reagan\\'s failure with his previous ability to win clear majorities on major issues. Sustaining his veto required him to win just one-third of the votes in either house of Congress. It was the third consecutive fight over a presidential veto on which Congress had defied Reagan, whose clout with the legislature has been greatly diminished by the arms-for-Iran scandal and the capture of a majority in the Senate by the opposition Democratic party in the November 1986 election. Congress overrode Reagan\\'s veto of a popular water projects bill in January and last autumn Congress rejected his veto of economic sanctions against South Africa. But this time the president laid his full authority on the line, even making a rare journey to Capitol Hill to plead for support in person. With both the House and Senate in Democratic hands, analysts say Reagan is swiftly becoming a lame duck, facing difficulties in enacting his own legislative agenda, especially given the furore over the Iran arms deal. The situation contrasts with Reagan\\'s first six years in office when a Republican-controlled Senate and the backing of conservative Democrats in the House enabled Reagan to win passage of most of his legislative priorities. Reagan\\'s ability to veto legislation he dislikes had been his strongest weapon in dealing with Congress, but his defeat on the highway bill was expected to reduce the credibility of his veto power. Senator John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, told the New York Times earlier this week that if Reagan lost \"there will be no brake on -- if you suggest a presidential veto you will be laughed away.\" Yesterday\\'s defeat came two days after the House of Representatives\\' overwhelming rejection of a presidential veto on the highways bill by 350 votes to 73. White House strategists had presented the veto fight as a test of Reagan\\'s strength as he attempted to recover from the scandal over secret arms sales to Iran. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas pleaded with fellow party members to back Reagan because \"this may determine the strength of the presidency for the next 21 months.\" The defeat showed the problems facing any president in his final years in office. Reagan\\'s term expires in January 1989. A majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives and 13 in the Senate apparently decided their own political concerns have become more important than the president\\'s. \"President Reagan, he ain\\'t going to be running in 1988, but I am,\" Congressman Arthur Ravenel, a South Carolina Republican, said on Tuesday of his decision to back a bill that means money and jobs for his home district in new highway construction. The defeat interrupted a good streak for Reagan, who won applause for his selection in February of former Senate majority leader Howard Baker to replace Donald Regan as White House chief of staff, and was believed by most political analysts to have benefitted from a televised speech and a news conference on the Iran affair last month. A steady drop in Reagan\\'s job approval ratings appeared to level off in recent weeks. The president slumped from about 65 pct last autumn to about 42 pct after the Tower Commission report in February said he had failed to exercise proper control over the dealings with Iran. His approval rating hovers at 50 pct. Reagan said he was deeply disappointed by the Senate defeat but \"my efforts to control spending are not diminished.\" Democratic leader Robert Byrd said \"this isn\\'t going to make or break the president.\" REUTER ',\n",

It said in a report that the future of the Swedish refining business was bleak due to the steady drop in domestic oil consumption since the mid-1970s, a possible tightening of rules on sulphur content and competition from Norway's Mongstad facility of <Den Norske Stats Olieselskab> (Statoil) <STAT.OL> when its expansion is completed in the 1990s. The committee said the BP refinery, which lacks a de-sulphurisation plant, was likely to be closed or sold unless costly investments were made to enhance the facility's capacity to refine a broader range of products. But the committee noted that capacity utilisation had in recent years been above that of the European refining industry on average.

This is mainly because Raffinerie Tirlemontoise is in the relatively static sugar market, they added. The Glaverbel issue of 755,000 shares at 1,850 francs each was more than 100 times oversubscribed and analysts said this showed that there will be no lack of liquidity for the sugar refiner's offer.

              "  'RECENT SUGAR FALL SPARKS SOVIET, CHINESE BUYING\\n\\nThe recent fall in world sugar prices, due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said. Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly market report. \"And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for May/June shipment, Man added. The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said. Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5 mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being countered by a reduction in China\\'s production forecast to 5.3 mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier. Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could be close to last year\\'s 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down. Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates Cuba\\'s export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln tonnes. However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters with reduced availability, Man said. Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which has left exporters chasing falling import requirements. A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still overhanging the market, Man said. The increasing cases of record production as a result of record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers to strive for greater efficiency. As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said. Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully compensate producers when exporting on the world market. Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar is expected to remain in intervention, it added. REUTER ',\n",

Internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against a previous target of 3.5 pct. Mariano Rubio, governor of the Bank of Spain, the central bank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing at an annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to four pct if the government were to meet its five pct inflation target this year. Inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986. The forecast for private consumption growth remains unchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revised upwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct. Growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected to increase by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct. Export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from 5.2 pct due to the peseta's continuing strength against the dollar and slack external demand. Slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spending has lowered estimated GDP growth to three pct in 1987 from an earlier forecast 3.5 pct. GDP grew by three pct last year. The economy ministry is holding its inflation forecast to five pct, in spite of minister Carlos Solchaga's doubts last week on whether this target could be maintained if wage settlements continue to rise above the government's recommended five pct ceiling.

The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos on Wednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders. Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission has started to move in the right direction, but said his company had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into intervention. But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final agreement would be reached with the commission which would allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention. European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention to protest about export rebates which they say are too low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by the commission on Wednesday, according to commission sources. Under EC regulations, however, operators have another four to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before payment is made for it. A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes of West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, trade sources said here. This amount represents about a third of annual EC exports to non-EC countries. Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it had offered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000 tonnes. Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus on every 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fully bridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday's rebate was 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traders said. Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates to the full intervention price and said Wednesday's tender was a step in the right direction. Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised for export since the begining of the current campaign had been inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate. Trade sources said new regulations governing export rebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth the path for the commission to award larger export rebates in future. One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemed the commission had understood the protest action and was now moving towards adapting the situation accordingly, thereby allowing the operators to withdraw their sugar from intervention once they got satisfaction.

Stoltenberg said studies by international organisations had made it clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan major efforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign trade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy. \"No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, the U.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strong under-valuation,\" he said. Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in a swift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning the current trade dispute over semi-conductors. Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris currency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not been published. The Paris declaration did not state the levels at which central banks of the major industrialised countries would intervene. Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully considered. He said he had nothing further to add. Stoltenberg also appeared to suggest that West Germany was now no longer under any pressure from the U.S. Government to stimulate its economy. He declined to respond specifically to a question on this subject but said, \"You must attach particular importance to the consensus which was reached in Paris.\" The minister nevertheless added that he would make clear during his trip to Washington that West Germany\\'s nominal trade figures gave a false impression about actual trade flows. Stoltenberg noted that in 1986 Bonn\\'s exports fell by a nominal two pct while its nominal imports fell by 10.7 pct. West Germany\\'s imports dropped largely because of foreign currency developments and the cheaper price of oil and led to a record trade surplus last year. However, Stoltenberg said that in real terms West Germany\\'s exports by volume had increased by 1.5 pct while real imports had risen by a much stronger 6.2 pct. In this way West Germany had made its contribution to economic stability, Stoltenberg added. Stoltenberg noted the government expected imports to rise by a real four to five pct in 1987 with exports stagnating. He said it was too early to revise official forecasts for West Germany\\'s economic growth this year. The government has forecast an unchanged 2.5 pct rise in Gross National Product. The Kiel Institute, a leading research body, is still expecting growth of three pct but some other research institutes have revised forecasts down to below two pct. Stoltenberg said the wide range of predictions showed how many imponderables had to be taken into account and said no drastic changes in official forecasts were needed. REUTER ',\n",

It was the third Soviet underground blast since Moscow halted an 18-month nuclear test moratorium last February, saying Washington's refusal to join the ban had forced it to resume testing. Moscow began its unilateral nuclear test moratorium in August 1985, calling on the United States to agree to a total ban on testing as the first step to nuclear disarmament. Last December it announced that it would end the freeze after the first U.S. Test this year. Washington had continued testing, saying the blasts were necessary to maintain its nuclear deterrent and that problems remained concerning the monitoring of a test freeze. The United States staged one test on February 3 and another on February 11. Moscow responded with a blast on February 26 and a second on March 12.

Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG <BAYG.F>, told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as well as crude oil and commodity prices. Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986. The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said. Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price competition and increased costs. Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years, neutralized the negative impact. Strenger said the industry would try to increase production in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of West Germany. The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and 22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East. Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct. Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late last year. REUTER \",\n",

              "  'U.S. TREASURY POLICIES SAID UNCHANGED BY DEPARTURE\\n\\nThe departure of James Baker\\'s closest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, will not change the course of Washington\\'s domestic and international economic policies, U.S. officials said. Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, was widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on currency management and international economic cooperation. U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role in shepherding President Reagan\\'s sweeping tax reform plan through the U.S. Congress. But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure, to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers, signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the Treasury Secretary himself might leave soon. \"It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as it came up,\" one official said. Another commented, \"Baker will miss him, but he\\'s not going to stand in his way.\" There has been widespread speculation since last autumn that Darman sought a Wall Street job. Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out. Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed. \"Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of this administration over the past six years and his departure represents a substantial loss,\" he said. U.S. Officials admitted Darman\\'s absence would be an undoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policy advice, both at the White House and, in Reagan\\'s second term, at the Treasury. One aide once described Darman as \"indispensable\" to Baker. Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency system and Darman is generally credited by officials of other nations as Baker\\'s leading theorist on this issue, favouring target zones to limit currency fluctuations. Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasury unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system. But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, with Darman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives. Baker\\'s work as head of Reagan\\'s Economic Policy Council, spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating with the Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before. Darman\\'s strength was not as an economist, but as a political strategist \"and that\\'s Baker\\'s strength too,\" the official said. There were already indications that Baker, who throughout his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of advisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor. One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould, who holds the number three Treasury position of Under-Secretary. Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years. Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was a partner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerly headed Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated. He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement, when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain curbed the dollar\\'s strength. The pact was a major turning point in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economic cooperation and intervention in currency markets. Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, like the Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of economic policies among the leading industrial countries and the recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and stimulate global growth. These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the huge gap between Japan and West Germany\\'s trade surpluses and the United State\\'s massive trade deficit. That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the Reagan Administration and will not change with Darman\\'s departure. REUTER ',\n",

The electricity company, which supplies about 90 pct of South Africa\\'s power, said in its annual report that it failed to attract any foreign loans in 1986, but it was confident of meeting its funding requirements this year, despite available finance from abroad remaining restricted. The utility, which once was South Africa\\'s largest borrower of foreign funds, said prearranged import financing facilities are expected to provide foreign funds of only about 300 mln rand this year. A further 550 mln rand will be borrowed from a blocked account administered by the South African government for the eventual repayment of about 13 billion rand in short-term loans. These are currently frozen by an effective moratorium on repayments. The blocked account is part of a debt accord recently reached with South Africa\\'s foreign creditor banks. South Africa declared a moratorium on repayments of about 14 billion dlrs of its original 24 billion dlr total foreign debt in September 1985 after foreign bankers abruptly cut off credit lines to the country because of concern over its deteriorating political and economic climate. Pretoria last week announced that it had reached a three-year rescheduling agreement with the major international creditors that will effectively extend a moratorium on most repayments of the short-term portion of the debt until mid-1990. Escom said it plans to meet the bulk of its funding requirements this year by raising 2.2 billion rand in the South African financial markets against a total of 1.75 billion rand raised last year. \"The borrowing programme for 1987 is well within the capacity of the (domestic) financial markets, without pressure being placed on interest rates,\" the corporation said. \"Last year we embarked on the most dramatic restructuring programme ever attempted by a major South African business, and we have largely achieved what we set out to do,\" Escom chairman, John Maree, told a news conference.

              "  'EC MINISTERS WILL DISCUSS STRENGTHENING EMS FLOAT\\n\\nEuropean Community finance ministers and central bankers meet in Belgium this weekend to discuss strengthening Europe\\'s joint currency float amid continuing worries about turbulence on foreign exchanges. Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who will host the informal talks, told Reuters the ministers and central bank chiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the light of the February agreement among leading industrialised countries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels. In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accord between the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada had proved itself \"more or less workable.\" But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been growing since fears of a trade war between the United States and Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a record low against the surging yen early this week. The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being held to coordinate the EC\\'s positions on monetary issues and Third World debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week. The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main discussions will take place tomorrow. Continued international currency turbulence could undermine plans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the joint float holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda. Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period of calm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stable dollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to make it more resilient against exchange rate swings. The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year as the falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertake two major realignments of parities within nine months. In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for a wide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMS on the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the EC\\'s Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central Bank Governors. The committees were asked to come up with the proposals after the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January. Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, the fledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take over the mark\\'s dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has met with a cool response in West Germany. He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would report to the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise capital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, such as the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls. Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without strengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation in the Community. He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member states were willing to push further towards the EC\\'s goal of monetary integration on the basis of an EMS that included management of exchange rates by some kind of common institution, instead of by national central banks as at present. Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen by the EMS\\'s founding fathers, have been thwarted by the reluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove up their sovereignty in the monetary field. EMS development has also been held up by Britain\\'s refusal so far to join the system\\'s core exchange rate mechanism. REUTER ',\n",

The number of non-farm payroll jobs rose 164,000 last month after rising a revised 236,000 in February. That was down from the previously reported 337,000 rise in February. The March unemployment rate was the lowest since March, 1980. It had remained unchanged at 6.7 pct for three straight months before the March decline.

The proposals aim to block loopholes open to financial groups with banking subsidiaries. According to current rules these groups are not bound by the same regulations prevailing in the traditional banking sector. The finance ministry proposals follow a recent bid by the Proventus financial group to create a new holding company that would control the third-largest commercial bank Gotabanken and Wermlandsbanken, a small regional bank. The proposal suggests that a holding company with a banking unit must be subject to the same rules which currently apply to the commercial banking operations, the finance ministry said in a statement. It added that July 1 this year was the proposed date of implementation for the measures, which will almost certainly be rubber-stamped by parliament. REUTER ',\n",
              "  'TALKING POINT/SANTA FE SOUTHERN <SFX>\\n\\nSanta Fe Southern Pacific Corp may have more difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off a possible takeover by Henley Group <HENG>, which has accumulated almost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroad conglomerate, analysts said. Takeover speculation has surrounded Santa Fe since Henley disclosed its stake in the company earlier this week, but analysts and a Santa Fe official were skeptical a takeover is its intention. Analysts also said the company has strong defenses that would easily deter any suitor - one of those being its problems combining its two railroad properties, which hang in regulatory limbo. Richard Fischer of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said that Santa Fe at December 31 had 580 mln dlrs in cash and cash equivalents, while its long-term debt to capital was just over 25 pct. \"This gives them plenty of borrowing power,\" he said, which could be used against an unwanted suitor. Henley Group\\'s Chairman Michael Dingman has said he wants to take major positions in undervalued natural resource companies. He also told Reuters in an interview he is seeking an acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs. Santa Fe officials don\\'t appear concerned that Henley might launch a takeover. \"I would not characterize the atmosphere around here as one of concern,\" one Santa Fe executive said about Henley. \"I think it\\'s wrong to assume Dingman has formed a firm strategy with Santa Fe,\" said Mark Hassenberg, who covers Henley for DLJ Securities. Analysts say the potential of Santa Fe\\'s land assets are likely to be realized slowly. They add that Santa Fe\\'s efforts to merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo, sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeable future. These realities, they said, support the Henley Group\\'s statement that its Santa Fe stake is only an investment. The more pressing problem facing Santa Fe is overcoming difficulties in merging its two railroads, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Co and Southern Pacific Transportation Co. The merger would create the nation\\'s second-longest railroad. Last July the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) denied the merger on anticompetitive grounds. The company since has granted trackage-sharing rights to four western railroads to meet the ICC\\'s concerns and persuade it to reopen the hearings in its three-year-old struggle to merge the lines. \"My guess is the commission will decide in three to six weeks whether to reopen hearings,\" Fischer said. \"I believe they\\'ve made an effort to satisfy the ICC\\'s objections,\" he said. \"But in doing so they haven\\'t pleased everyone. Before they had Burlington Northern on their side, now Burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are set up.\" If the hearings are reopened, analysts predicted it will take six to nine months for everyone to have their say, and up to another year for the ICC to decide. Santa Fe is in the midst of a 50-mln-share stock buyback program begun in 1984. It has bought back 33.7 mln shares as of February 1, when it had 154.7 mln shares outstanding, a spokesman said. Among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned by Norfolk Southern, one of 3.4 mln shares bought in 1986 and another of 1.7 mln shares in 1985, one analyst said. James Voytko at Paine Webber believes Santa Fe could fight off the Henley Group with its cash and credit. Citing the share buybacks from Norfolk Southern, he said one of Santa Fe\\'s options, if threatened, could be to buy the Henley stake. \"It is indeed possible that Dingman sees this as a low-risk, opportunistic investment,\" Voytko said. \"People who follow Santa Fe have given me values of 45 dlrs to 50 dlrs a share,\" said DLJ Securities\\' Hassenberg. \"But I\\'m certain that in Dingman\\'s mind, the company is worth more than that in breakup value.\" Reuter ',\n",

He told a news conference ahead of the IMF talks that discussions about developing country debt problems would play an important role on the agenda in Washington. Stoltenberg noted that Brazil had agreed in January to work together with the banks but said this pledge had not yet been fulfilled. After Brazil imposed a moratorium on interest payments on 68 billion dlrs worth of debt in February, Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro sought to involve foreign governments in rescheduling talks with banks. But British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson rebuffed Funaro's bid and said commercial bank loans were a matter for banks and not governments. West German bankers also said then that Brazil should seek an understanding with the IMF. Stoltenberg said in Bonn today that he had already told Funaro that the unilateral moratorium was a mistake. Stoltenberg said that despite progress in some areas, the debt problems of a whole range of countries had recently become more difficult. He said flows from commercial banks had decreased markedly and that the refusal of some highly indebted countries to fulfil their commitments to private creditors or with the IMF was one reason for this. He also said that when debtor countries came up with good, confidence-inspiring policies, commercial banks should react with more flexibility in interest structures, maturities and rescheduling. Many debtor countries had realised that it was not possible to mobilise capital flows, and especially direct investments, without such policies, Stoltenberg said. REUTER \",\n",

              "  \"JAPAN STUDY URGES FOREIGN ACCESS TO FARM MARKETS\\n\\nJapan should increase foreign access to its farm products market, while encouraging further development of domestic agriculture, a government report said. The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31 said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks will help prepare Japan to improve access. Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an easing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports which stressed the need for strict controls on some products to maintain self-sufficiency in food. Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs, down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show. The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances. The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly responsible for higher domestic prices, it said. The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has worsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the paper said. This could make it difficult to improve the industry's structure, the paper said. To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices to more reasonable levels, Japan should try to restructure the the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it self-supporting, it said.

              "  'JAPANESE BANKS EXPAND HONG KONG PRESENCE\\n\\nAt a time when Britain is threatening to revoke the license of Japanese banks in retaliation for restrictive trade practices, Hong Kong is rolling out the welcome mat to Japan. The British colony last week issued a banking licence to the Bank of Fukuoka Ltd, making it the 24th Japanese bank here. Japan has the largest banking contingent in Hong Kong, followed by the U.S. With 22 banks. Eleven Japanese banks have representative offices here and Japanese institutions operate 34 deposit-taking companies (DTCs). Assistant banking commissioner K.K Wong told Reuters: \"There are no special favours towards the Japanese...But because of Japan\\'s strong economy and currency, they easily meet our requirement on assets (14 billion U.S. Dlrs).\" The Japanese control the largest share of assets of the financial institutions here but incorporated elsewhere, with 980.5 billion H.K. Dlrs at end-1986, or 57.5 pct of the total. \"Hong Kong authorities welcome Japanese banks,\" said Haruo Kimura, assistant general manager of the Bank of Tokyo. \"But the U.S. And Britain are unhappy with the slow liberalisation of the Tokyo financial market.\" Japanese bankers said Hong Kong offers good business opportunities, especially in China trade, to Japanese banks who are following their clients\\' international expansion. \"As their clients become more international, they have to keep up and follow them,\" said Yutaka Toda, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank\\'s general manager here. \"We can have access to local traders and regional corporations,\" said Bank of Tokyo\\'s Kimura. \"We can also pick up business with China.\" Bankers said more Japanese banks are on the way. An influx of Japanese banks began in the late 1970s when the government lifted a moratorium on new licences. But newcomers are allowed one branch each and only the Bank of Tokyo, Sanwa Bank and Sumitomo Bank have more than one branch. Because of this limitation, Japanese banks have mostly concentrated on wholesale business. \"It is very difficult to compete with those giants such as the Hongkong Bank and the Bank of China,\" said Kimura of the Bank of Tokyo. Bank of Tokyo has the largest Japanese bank network here with seven branches, while Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp and the Bank of China groups each have hundreds of branches. To broaden their client and deposit base, some Japanese banks have taken equity in local banks. The latest such move was Dai-Ichi Kangyo\\'s increase of its stake in Chekiang First Bank last year to 95 pct from 33 pct. Tokai Bank, Fuji Bank and Mitsubishi Bank also have interests in small local banks. But Mitsubishi, not content with its single-branch licence and a 25 pct stake in the small Liu Chong Hing Bank, bought Mercantile Bank Ltd\\'s multi-branch licence early this year. \"We will open one more branch in (Hong Kong\\'s district of) Kowloon soon, to better serve our clients on the other side of the harbour,\" said Mitsubishi Bank general manager Takeshi Tange. Their weakness in the retail market forces Japanese banks to rely on the interbank market for funding. Government data show that despite their large share of total assets, Japanese banks had only 54.4 billion dlrs in deposits at end-1986, or 17.1 pct of deposits of banks in Hong Kong incorporated elsewhere. \"Most Japanese banks\\' international lendings in the region are booked in Hong Kong,\" said a Japanese banker who declined to be named. He said it is mainly for tax reasons, adding that assets such as loans booked in Hong Kong are not subject to Japanese tax. Japanese banks are barred by the Tokyo government from issuing Eurobonds, but their Hong Kong subsidiaries can tap the Euromarket and lend the funds to the parent. Bankers said this role could be undermined by a five pct capital adequacy ratio that goes into effect next year, requiring many DTC\\'s to increase their capital. Many Japanese banks are seeking special treatment for their largely offshore operations or a different risk calculation for their assets. \"I don\\'t think this will stop them from coming here,\" said a banker. \"But it may mean they have to conduct some of their offshore funding operations elsewhere.\" REUTER ',\n",

Government sources said the blockage would also delay an announcement of measures that would simplify the procedure for non-residents to recoup the 25 pct withholding tax levied on investment income in Belgium. Finance Minister Mark Eyskens told Reuters yesterday that he hoped the cabinet would approve the bourse transaction tax proposals today. Eyskens also said he would in the next few days announce plans to simplify and eventually stop the procedure for foreign investors to reclaim witholding tax. Financial analysts said the current procedure is so slow that it effectively acts as a barrier to foreign investment in Belgium, especially in the bond market.

These are set at three rates -- 0.07 pct, 0.14 pct and 0.35 pct -- according to the security transacted.

              "  'IMF, WORLD BANK TO MEET AMID NEW INFLATION FEARS\\n\\nAmid new concerns about inflation, interest rate increases and trade confrontations, finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss a deteriorating global debt and economic situation. The meetings, under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates are turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further, upsetting bond and stock markets. Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new assistance. Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works. The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil, which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded by laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans. Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in a visit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out the administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to the very poorest states. The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers in detail during next week\\'s meetings and will undoubtedly be embraced by the developing countries. \"There\\'s interest on the part of some countries for looking at the support of the special problems of the very poorest countries, because their position is so extreme,\" a Reagan administration official said. He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue. The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt initiative, which called for new funding to help debtor countries grow out of their problems. The largest industrial countries have been attempting to coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the decline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and other problems. At the same time, the industrial countries see little evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund forecasts they will grow 2.5 pct. The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself, continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked other industrial countries to stimulate their economies. These issues directly affect the debt problem and the ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their difficulties. In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports of developing country, allowing them to earn critical foreign exchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit, running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing others to import more from developing countries. The discussions, from April six to 10, will be wide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to the impact of development loans on the environment, according to monetary sources. The talks will include an examination of trade protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on microchip products from Japan, the sources said. The move accelerated the dollar\\'s decline as financial markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing. There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. charges that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair market value and has kept its own market closed to imports, further undermining the international trading system. At the same time, the ministers will discuss the fundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the export mainstay of many developing countries. The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- will gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris, where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further. The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for further debate on economic policy coordination. As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such as Japan agreed to stimulate their economies, while America said it would reduce its federal budget deficit. Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to to have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American Development Bank, strengthening the link between loans and economic policy changes in debtor nations. Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more account of the environment when making loan for dams and other projects. The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said this issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization plan for the Bank, now being prepared. Reuter ',\n",

              "  'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TOKYO HARD ON FOREIGN TRADERS\\n\\nOverseas securities firms are spending millions of dollars to set up operations in Tokyo, but many will end up losing money, industry sources said. For banks and securities firms eager to establish themselves as international players, building a presence in Japan has become an imperative. Thirty-six are already licensed to trade securities on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the world\\'s second largest. More than 50 are expected by year-end. But, as deregulation erodes brokers\\' profits and the global share-buying spree is predicted to subside, only those securities traders with first-class financial muscle will survive, the sources said. \"There will be foreigners\\' fallout. They come in here with too glib ideas about how they can survive,\" said David Miller, director and general manager of Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd\\'s Tokyo branch. Despite soaring share prices, sharp falls in commissions on stock transactions have hurt even brokerages that came to Tokyo early. \"Japanese equities are no longer a very profitable business. The margins are nothing like they were two or three years ago. Things are not as rosy as they may seem,\" Miller said. Publicly reported earnings of foreign securities houses in Japan for the half-year ended September 30, 1986, showed Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd on top with profits of 1.7 billion yen. Most other firms reported hefty gains over the year before. But industry sources say the figures do not fully reveal the costs of running an international brokerage in the world\\'s most expensive city. Salary packages with free housing for novice analysts routinely run more than 100,000 dlrs a year. Miller, whose firm had earnings of 1.4 billion yen for the half-year to September 1986, said costs for an operation strong enough to endure are 10 to 15 mln dlrs a year. \"I\\'d be surprised if more than two or three were making money if they honestly accounted for their costs,\" he said. To bring commissions closer to world rates, the Finance Ministry slashed fixed brokerage fees last year, especially on large-lot deals. In a few years, all rates may be negotiated as they are in New York and London, industry sources said. Since last October\\'s Big Bang deregulation of London\\'s financial markets, at least half the equity trading deals there have generated no commission income at all. Stockbroking firms are unlikely to make money until some are forced out of business, analysts said. The first foreign firms to set up here, especially the six admitted as members in February 1986, have an advantage over the latecomers, they said. The six are <Merrill Lynch Japan Inc>, <Goldman Sachs International Corp>, <Morgan Stanley International Inc>, <Vickers Da Costa Ltd>, <Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd> and <S.G. Warburg and Co (Japan) Ltd>. The memberships, which cost about five mln dlrs, allow firms to execute their own trades and, unlike houses with branch status, avoid paying away 27 pct of their commissions to have member firms place trades. Members can also communicate instantly with the exchange floor, a vital source of information in a market that tends to follow the leader. Sources said seven to 10 more seats on the exchange are likely to open up sometime in 1988. For non-member firms, wrestling away market share from tenacious Japanese and foreign firms is costly and intangibles sometimes prove even more important than exchange membership. \"Your name is better known if you\\'re a member of the right club,\" Miller said. \"It\\'s easier to hire ... New people.\" To inaugurate its Japan operation, <SBCI Securities (Asia) Ltd> flew out the Basel Ballet last January for receptions in Tokyo and Osaka. The firm, 50 pct owned by <Swiss Bank Corp>, gave guests gifts of Swiss chocolates and Swatch watches. \"It\\'s expensive, but a party like that is a token of the serious way we regard our development in Tokyo,\" SBCI\\'s Tokyo branch manager Gregory Shenkman said. To establish its position quickly, SBCI hired a 26-strong research unit from <W.I. Carr (Overseas) Ltd>\\'s Tokyo office. \"I was very lucky,\" Shenkman said. \"I was anticipating a considerable struggle to organically develop a research team. \"I am not particularly optimistic for the prospects in the Japanese equity market for continental European banks who have little experience in equities outside their domestic equity market,\" he said. But the prospect of closing down operations may be worse. \"One would be ill-advised to open here and close, and then decide to open again two or three years later. I\\'m not sure the Japansese community would respond well to that sort of attitude,\" he said. REUTER ',\n",

              "  \"WESSANEN FORESEES STRONG PROFIT GROWTH\\n\\nDutch dairy and general foods manufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV <WESS.AS>, said it is planning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strong profit growth over the next 10 years. Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at the presentation of Wessanen's 1986 report he already expected 1987 first quarter profits to show an increase. The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985. This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar's guilder value, van Driel said. Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guilders higher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985 level of 3.20 guilders. Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mln guilders down because of the lower dollar and lower raw material prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders. US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover, compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separate businesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide. Van Driel said the company would continue an active takeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying more than its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit. He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisition possibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China. He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mln guilders and would if necessary make new share issues. Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mln dlrs. He said <Balanced Foods> and <Green's Dairy>, taken over late last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrs which was not included in the 1986 account. All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13 pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key to this growth was the successful introduction of new products, which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented US acquisitions, van Driel said. Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986 turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said. The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich, Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims to be quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said. Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not be accompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehicles for the company to raise capital for future expansion. He estimated that 33 pct of the company's shares were in foreign hands. The company's 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made a listing on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step, van Driel said without elaborating. Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which produces around 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospects for its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said. REUTER \",\n",
              "  'CHINA PUTS BRAKE ON KEY REFORM GOAL\\n\\nFear of social instability and inflation has forced China to put the brakes on one of its most important economic reforms -- overhauling a pricing system which often bears no relation to production costs. The price clampdown has occurred during a conservative backlash following the resignation in January of reformist Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang, Western diplomats and Chinese sources say. \"In recent years, prices have not only been rising, but the rate of increase is getting faster and faster,\" the People\\'s Daily said in a major article this week. \"In future, price changes should be only in small steps.\" Despite pledges last year that price changes were essential to get the economy on the right track, the government has repeatedly said no major change will happen this year. \"Price changes in the last two years have aroused great public discontent, especially in the cities,\" a Western diplomat said. \"Chinese were used to stable prices for 30 years from 1949 when the Communists took over. On a recent visit to two major cities, the refrain from all the officials was the need to preserve social stability,\" he said. A Chinese journalist said the reformers had underestimated the extent to which the public would tolerate price changes. \"A major review of all economic reforms is under way, the biggest since the reforms began in 1979, because many things are not going well -- a large budget deficit, too rapid price increases and no major improvement in productivity of state firms,\" he said. The reformers think it vital to change a system under which prices often bear no relation to production costs. Sugar is an example. An official newspaper said earlier this year that more than 40 pct of China\\'s sugar mills were losing money or had closed because producing sugar was so unprofitable. This was because the selling price of sugar has not changed for 20 years, while the mills\\' production costs have risen sharply over the period. The economic masterplan for the 1986-90 period, published in April last year, said China would \"work steadily to establish a pricing system which better reflects value and the relation between supply and demand.\" The People\\'s Daily said that in recent years wage increases had been too high and too much currency printed, resulting in too much money chasing too few goods and causing price hikes and inflation. The review of the reforms coincides with a national campaign against \"bourgeois liberalism,\" meaning Western political ideas blamed for causing student protests last December. The journalist said the review was in part due to political factors. \"Economics and politics are inseparable in China. But the Western media is wrong to classify the leadership into reformers and conservatives. All the leaders agree on the main direction -- economic reform and the open-door,\" he said. \"But there are differences of opinion on the pace of reform and on specific policies. No one is advocating a return to how things were before 1979.\" The diplomat said what China feared as a backlash against price rises was not so much rioting in the streets, which he said it had the means to control. \"The bottom line is how such protests would be used by those in the power struggle.\" A foreign lawyer said he believed the cause of the crisis earlier this year was that the Communist Party leadership had feared, due to the student demonstrations, that it was losing control. \"The leadership here is a self-perpetuating oligarchy. There is no way that it is going to give up power,\" he said. Reuter ',\n",

              "  'PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTER\\n\\nPakistan is not emerging as a major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough, Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview. No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price, he said. Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable. The government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices, and the land would be better used for other crops. Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds. The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years, he said. Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year\\'s yield of 14.0 mln. He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly. The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan\\'s annual population growth rate of more than three pct. Current consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes. The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said. This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a \"strategic reserve\" target of two mln tonnes. Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said. The government wants to keep an extra \"safety margin\" until it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat rationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports will be considered only in about a year\\'s time when the 1987/88 crop can be gauged as well, he said. The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for the government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two rupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo. Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and due to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply. Aziz said following the introduction of a government support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills. The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said. Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive Pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March 1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30. Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better use of side-products such as bran. Reuter ',\n",

In a letter to the West German community here, Ambassador Joerg Kastl said laboratory tests on food samples bought in Moscow in February had shown elevated levels of caesium-134 and -137 in tea from Azerbaijan and Ukrainian hazelnuts. Other food samples sent for testing at Cologne University, including honey, fruit, vegetables, pork, milk and butter, were found to be free of radiation, it said. Data in the letter showed the tea and hazelnuts contained caesium levels far in excess of ceilings recommended by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). The letter said people who had consumed the tea faced no particular health danger as most of the caesium remained in the tea leaves, but it warned against eating the hazelnuts. The products sent for testing were bought in state shops and private farmers\\' markets in Moscow, it added. Other Western embassies in Moscow said they had discontinued laboratory testing of Soviet food late last year because no abnormal radiation levels were detected. \"We didn\\'t find anything so we stopped doing it,\" a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. A British spokesman said radiation-monitoring equipment remained in the embassy waiting room for British residents in Moscow who wanted to check their food, but laboratory tests had not been conducted for several months. \"Earlier we sent some food back to Britain as a precautionary measure, but we stopped in the absence of any alarming signals,\" he said. \"If the tests had shown abnormal readings, they would have been resumed.\" Reuter ',\n",

              "  'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EFTA FEARS EC MARKET PLANS\\n\\nThe European Community wants to eliminate all obstacles to free movement of goods, services and people by 1992, a laudable goal that has sent shivers down the spines of its closest trading neighbours. Europe\\'s outsiders -- the six members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and other small states -- fear the growing power of the 12 EC member countries, a market of 320 mln people, one and a half times as big as the whole U.S. And as the Community celebrates its 30th anniversary, in non-EC countries from Ankara to Oslo, an attitude is emerging which says, \"If you can\\'t beat them, join them.\" In June 1985, the Community adopted a plan to create an \"internal market\" without restrictions, which included new goals on everything from tourism to the rules of bank accounting. The plan is so extensive that even the EFTA countries -- Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland -- with decades of close trade ties, find it hard to adopt a joint position. Last month Turkey formally requested EC membership, receiving a polite reply from Brussels that the time was not ripe. In Austria, where its 1955 charter of neutrality forbids joining political alliances, the government is looking for ways to become a \"de facto\" EC member. And in Norway, where membership was rejected in a 1972 referendum, government officials are wondering whether the political climate has changed. But nowhere has the debate been more existential than in Switzerland, which has resisted all alliances for 700 years. The Swiss are a microcosm of Europe, living geographically in the very heart of Europe and speaking the languages of the three big economies -- Germany, France and Italy. Swiss neutrality, which has kept the country out of the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund, would seem to preclude membership in the Community, given the EC\\'s loose link with the Western defence alliance NATO. But an opinion poll late last year, held in the French-speaking part of the country, showed a majority favoured joining the Community. Since then, government officials have stressed that, while membership was impossible, Switzerland should do everything possible not to be locked out when the trade barriers inside the EC come down. State secretary for foreign trade Franz Blankart, said it is inconceivable the whole Swiss nation -- including the more conservative German-speaking majority -- would vote for membership. But Switzerland must be more than just a \"satellite,\" he said, now that the enlarged Community is extending itself into areas omitted by the founding Treaty of Rome. These areas, including pharmaceutical research and technological development, are the key to the economic future of Switzerland and the Community alike, he adds. \"We cannot permit ourselves the luxury of passively following the Community\\'s new dynamic of integration,\" he says. The Swiss economy ministry has drawn up a detailed analysis of the EC White Paper on the internal market, outlining the Swiss response to each point. While some refer to a collective EFTA stance, officials admit that on many issues Switzerland may have act alone. The new EC plans on transport, for example, would have a severe impact on Switzerland and Austria, whose roads carry most of the traffic between Italy and its EC partners. But rules such as the volume of petrol buses are allowed to carry across a border have much less importance to Sweden or Finland. Switzerland wants to work out ways to help people crossing its borders with West Germany, France and Italy. But it is afraid the liberal border controls Denmark, an EC member, has with the non-EC Nordic countries might pose a threat to security. And pin the fields of banking and insurance -- the very lifeblood of Switzerland\\'s service sector -- Swiss interests could prove directly opposite to its EFTA partners with their pppppppnarrow and tightly protected financial markets. The biggest danger ahead, EFTA members have said, would be that their divided interests might leave the EC free to set whatever guidelines and standards it wanted and force them on other European states that wanted to trade.

In 1986, Time reported earnings of 5.95 dlrs per share, including a number of special items. Bigelow said in adjusting the 1986 results for the special items and also removing the earnings of American Television and Communications Corp <ATCMA>, Time earned 2.35 dlrs per share in 1986. Turner Broadcasting System Inc said the investment by the cable consortium would be in Turner Broadcasting, not directly in CNN. The consortium would infuse up to 550 mln dlrs in Turner Broadcasting in return for a 35 pct equity interest. Ted Turner, Chairman, would retain a 51 pct interest, a Turner Broadcasting spokesman said. Bigelow said the company is continuing its previously announced 10 mln share repurchase program and has bought back 4.1 mln of its own shares. He said 700,000 shares were purchased in the first quarter of 1987 at an average price of 81 dlrs per share. Bigelow said the company will always have a share buyback program in place whenever it believes it is a better long-term investment than starting or acquring a business. But he did not give any specifics on further repurchases beyond the 10 mln shares already announced. On the subject of acquisitions, Richard Munro, chairman and chief executive said the company is not interested in investing in over-the-air broadcasting, but continues to look at all areas in which it is currently engaged. Munro said book publishing is an area that interested Time. In 1986 the company purchased Scott and Foresman, its biggest acquisition ever. N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said the company might be interested in a relatively small book business. He said following the recent agreement for the sale of Harper and Row to the News Corp Ltd <NWS>, \"there may be pieces that Murdoch doesn\\'t want,\" referring to News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch. Asked if the company\\'s SAMI business is for sale, Munro said it is a \"delicate subject\", and \"we\\'re looking at all the options.\" SAMI is a marketing information service for the food industry. Published reports have stated it could be worth as much as 500 mln dlrs. Bigelow said that Time\\'s Home Box Office added subscribers last year and the trend is continuing in the first quarter of 1987. However, he said, HBO\\'s results in the quarter will be down slightly, but in the first quarter of 1986 there was a special gain in the HBO unit. Nicholas said that HBO and Cinemax had combined subscriber growth of 800,000 for last year. He also said the tax rate in 1987 will remain at just under 50 pct because of the repeal of investment tax credits and higher state and local taxes. He said he sees a decrease in the tax rate in 1988 of five or six percentage points. Munro said the company does not plan to increase its dividend. Trygve Myhren, chairman and chief executive of American Television and Communications, said the unit is looking at getting involved in the home shopping video area. \"It would be foolish not to be a player there,\" he said.

              "  'ITALY SETS BANK CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS\\n\\nThe Bank of Italy issued details of new bank capital adequacy requirements due to come into force in June, in a central bank circular. The Bank of Italy circular follows an interministerial committee decision last December to introduce minimum capital adequacy requirements for banks. The requirements, which formalise criteria already in use, comprise a risk-asset ratio applicable to banking operations including foreign branches, and a gearing ratio which excludes business of foreign branches. The risk-asset ratio measures solvency, defined as a bank\\'s ability to meet all its liabilities through the realisation of its assets, while the second establishes the minimum capital a bank must hold relative to its size. Specifically, total credits and off balance sheet items of domestic and foreign branches must not exceed an amount equivalent to 12.5 times the bank\\'s capital, net of stakes held in Italian banks. The gearing ratio limits total financial assets of domestic branches to 22.5 times capital, net of stakes held in Italian banks. The Bank of Italy said the requirements corresponded to a risk-asset ratio of eight pct and a gearing ratio of 4.4 pct. For both ratios, the value of equity investments and stakes other than those in Italian banks will be deducted from the capital multiple. The total credit risk of an individual bank will be calcluated by assigning specific weights to the various categories of financial assets and off balance sheet assets. The weighting will be based essentially on credit risk and will not take into account guarantees, other forms of risk transfer or potential losses linked to exchange or interest rates. The definition of capital on which the ratios will be calculated comprises shareholders\\' equity and disclosed legal reserves plus \"general provisions having the character of reserves.\" Own shares held in portfolio will be excluded. The Bank of Italy said it would set more stringent individual ratios for those banks running greater risks regarding items such as the quality, mobility and concentration of assets, and to liquidity and management adequacy. The new ratios will be applied to all banks operating in Italy. Banks which are not in line with the requirements by June 1987 \"must correct their position in the shortest time possible,\" the Bank of Italy said. A transition period would be allowed but would not be more than four years. Italian branches of foreign banks will be exempted from the risk ratio when the parent banks are already subject to similar ratios but must comply with the gearing ratio. The Bank of Italy said the introduction of capital ratios aimed to further enhance capital adequacy at a time of increasing competitiveness and was a further step in bringing Italy into line with supervisory norms in other countries.

Howard told Reuters he would try to \"promote understanding on trade issues\" during his trip, which starts tomorrow. Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japan\\'s prime minister promising his personal help for a solution to the row over a U.K. Firm\\'s bid to win a significant role in Japan\\'s liberalised telecommunications market, government sources said. Tensions have risen following the decision by Britain to arm itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be used against certain Japanese financial insitutions. Britain had reacted optimistically at first to the letter from Japanese leader Yasuhiro Nakasone to U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. It had been seen as a signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L>, officials said. But this view has been clouded by reports from Tokyo that Nakasone\\'s assurances really constituted little more than politeness in the face of loud British anger, they added. Howard said he would use his trip to push for a bigger role in Japan\\'s telecommunications industry for Cable and Wireless Plc. The U.K. Government has made the issue a test case for Japan\\'s willingness to open its markets adequately to outside competition. Asked whether the letter from Nakasone was a rejection of attempts by Britain to achieve that, Howard said \"I am not sure it is correct to regard Mr Nakasone\\'s letter as a rejection of Mrs Thatcher\\'s request of him - and it says he is taking a personal interest in this problem.\" \"I don\\'t understand it to be closed at all.\" During his visit to Tokyo, Howard said \"I shall be talking to them about it (the letter), finding out exactly what they do mean about it, and making it plain that we take a very serious view of the fact that access to Japanese markets is not as free as we allow acces to our markets to be.\" He noted that under the new Financial Services Act, Britain could revoke or deny licences to Japanese banking and insurance institutions in London if U.K. Firms fail to get receive similar treatment in financial markets in Japan soon. \"I hope it won\\'t come to that, and I don\\'t think it will,\" Howard added.

The original announcement said the guarantees included three mln dlrs for lumber, except plywood. Melvin Sims, USDA general sales manager, told Reuters he did not anticipate any plywood would be included in the sales, but that \"it\\'s possible it would be.\" Plywood in the past has not been eligible for GSM-102 credit guarantees because it is considered by some to be a manufactured product.

However, the Reagan administration is considering whether to allow plywood sales to be covered by the credit guarantee program, Sims said. Second, the USDA announcement said 6.0 mln dlrs of a previously announced 6.0-mln dlr line for tallow under GSM-102 was available for both public and private sector importers.

              "  'EXCHANGE SEEN APPROVING \"WHEN ISSUED\" GILT TRADE\\n\\nThe Stock Exchange is virtually certain to agree to change its regulations in order to permit \"when issued\" trading of U.K. Government bonds (gilts) as part of an experimental series of bond auctions later this year, market sources said. \"The principle that this \"when issued\\' trading should take place has been accepted by the Executive Committee of the International Stock Exchange,\" said George Nissen, chairman of the Gilt Edged Market Makers\\' Association (GEMMA). \"It\\'s a question of how, rather than whether,\" he told Reuters. The Bank of England announced in February that it planned a possible series of experimental auctions for gilts, similar to the system used to market U.S. Treasury issues, with the first auction possibly in April or May. The Bank said at that stage that it was not opposed in principle to \"when issued\" trading developing in bonds in the period between the announcement of full details of the auction and the auction itself, as in the U.S. However, \"when issued\" trading is prohibited under the rules of the International Stock Exchange, formerly the London Stock Exchange, and would require an amendment in order to proceed. Nissen said discussions on the technical details of a rule change to allow \"when issued\" trading were still taking place between the Government broker at the Bank of England and the Quotations Department of the Stock Exchange. The 27 gilt-edged primary dealers regard the introduction of grey market trading as an essential feature of an auction system covering part of the Government\\'s funding needs. \"If we are going into an auction system, we need to have some form of market test of the stock we\\'re bidding for,\" said Simon Hartnell, Head Trader at primary dealer Alexanders Laing and Cruickshank Gilts Ltd. \"The American WI (when issued) market certainly functions very efficiently,\" he said. Nissen said he believed that if \"when issued\" trading were not allowed, market-makers \"would be extremely unhappy about the whole auction.\" Gilt dealers noted that it was a basic provision of Stock Exchange rules that dealing could not take place in a stock until it was listed by the Quotations Department. However, this was mainly designed to prevent a grey market springing up in equities prior to listing. They pointed out that in contrast to the many uncertainties connected with an issue of equity securities, there would be few imponderables relating to bonds just about to be issued by the Bank of England. Senior market sources noted that in any case \"when issued\" trading would be supervised by the Stock Exchange and would be subject to Bank of England supervisory guidelines. Since the Bank of England and market-makers themselves are known to be in favour of the idea, the sources said, there was now a presumption that there would be scope for \"when issued\" trading to take place. Gilt sales now are effected by means of large-scale stock tenders or by tap issues of stock tranches direct to the market. But greater market capitalisation following the \"Big Bang\" restructuring last year provided an opportunity for change. A combination of both systems would enable the Bank to benefit from both the flexibility offered by traditional marketing methods and the guarantee of a steady supply of funds implied by auctions. The Bank said in a consultative document published in February that possibly two or three experimental auctions might each raise between one to 1-1/2 billion stg. The remainder of the funding would be conducted by traditional tender and tap issue means. Total gross official sales of gilt-edged stock were 11.9 billion stg in 1985/86. Nissen said that market-makers had agreed unanimously with the bank\\'s view that auctions would be more easily conducted on a price basis, rather than based on yield. He said that the odds were also in favour of adoption of a bid price form of auction, where successful bidders were allotted stock at the various prices at which they bid, rather than a common price allotment whereby stock was allocated at the lowest accepted price. Hartnell said that while a \"when issued\" facility was crucial to market-makers\\' adaptation to the new system, he would also have liked to see an extension to the \"fallow\" period proposal made by the Bank of England. The Bank said that it would not sell by any method stock of the same type as that to be auctioned between the time of the announcement of auction details and a period ending 28 days after the auction itself. Noting that in the case of long bond auctions, U.S. Primary dealers have as much as three months between successive sales of stock, Hartnell said the Bank\\'s proposal was \"very tight.\" Nissen said that following a meeting between GEMMA and the Bank of England on March 3, which he described as \"very helpful,\" GEMMA submitted a note making several further residual points. Market-makers are now awaiting a further, fairly definitive, paper from the Bank which would contain details of auction procedures. Although the Bank has not yet formally announced a definite intention to proceed with the auctions, most market participants assume that they will go ahead. \"My own view is that we are on course and the first indications from the original paper - an auction at the end of April or in May - must be the best assumption,\" he said.

              "  \"EC WHEAT RELEASE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY U.K. DEMAND\\n\\nThe European Commission's decision to release an additional 300,000 tonnes of British intervention feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate relief in an increasingly tight market, traders said. Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage, pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender the market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonnes were granted. The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to satisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition for supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm. The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong representations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission. There has been growing concern that rising internal prices, triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage in interior markets. The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at the April 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month. The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May and June. News of the release produced an early downward reaction in local physical markets, but by midday some sections had halved early two stg losses while others were unchanged. Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mln tonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the free market. However, some traders believe these figures are overstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, the bulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also off the market in futures stores. A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been sold for export or to the home market since the season started July 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59 mln tonnes. Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln tonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said. This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed all early expectations and has created the present nervous situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in August. The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a new record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes achieved in the 1984/85 season. Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and barley around 4.50 mln tonnes. The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln tonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28 mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traders said. Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British grain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mln tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compares with 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season. The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to stay buoyant for the remaining few months of the season. If supplies become more difficult and prices strengthen further, feed compounders may increase cereal substitute usage, traders said. Reuter \",\n",

Total investment this year, the country's second as a member of the European Community (EC), will rise nearly 10 pct, again the same rate as last year, the central bank study said. It added that Portugal's current account was forecast to show a surplus of 400 mln dlrs this year compared with 1.13 billion in 1986 and 369 mln the previous year. Last year's high surplus was attributed to cheaper oil and raw materials, lower world interest rates and a weaker dollar. Imports by volume were forecast to grow 10 pct this year and exports four pct compared with increases of 16.5 pct and 6.6 pct respectively in 1986, the bank said. The forecasts were calculated on the assumption that the non-expansionary monetary policy carried out by the current government would be maintained, particularly in budget spending and income and in wage policy. The bank added that the 1987 forecasts were also based on the assumption that the international economic situation and Portugal's world trade relations would remain more or less the same as in 1986. The central bank said the high rate of investment estimated for 1986 was due to government policies and to increasing optimism among firms whose financial situation had improved since 1985.

Mortality rates from two other types of cancer, respiratory cancer and leukemia, had declined compared to earlier studies, the plastics and chemicals company said. Potential causes and incidence of pancreatic, colon/rectal, prostate and bladder cancer will be studied further, a company spokesman said. The studies found elevated mortality rates from the four cancer types. But the finding does not appear to be linked with products or processes at the plant, Rohm and Haas said.

And deaths from leukemia have fallen to near normal levels from those reported in 1975. A study completed in 1974 after an outbreak of respiratory cancer among employees linked the disease to exposure to a carcinogen, bischloromethyl ether, which is made at the plant. The production of the chemical, an intermediary used in making industrial fluid cleaners, was isolated in 1971 so workers were no longer exposed to it, the spokesman said.

              "  'FAA FEARS CRACKS ON OLDER MCDONNELL <MD> JUMBOS\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said it ordered U.S. airlines to inspect their older DC10 jumbo jets within five days for hairline cracks in tail areas. The FAA action follows a warning to the airlines by the plane\\'s maker, Douglas Aircraft Co, that three cracks had been discovered on two DC10s. Douglas Aircraft is a unit of McDonnell Douglas Corp. Such cracks typically are caused by metal fatigue and pose no safety risk if repaired. The cracks were found in the metal skin covering the tail, during aircraft maintenance. If not detected and repaired, the cracks \"may progress until the spar cap or skin panel is severed, which could result in structural failure,\" the FAA order said. The spar cap is the top part of the tail wings\\' main beam. The FAA said the inspection order would apply to airplanes with over 40,000 hours of flight or more than 12,000 landings. Reuter ',\n",

              "  \"VW PLANS MAJOR NEW PLANT IN CHINA\\n\\nVolkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, VW, plans to construct a major new car plant in China, a company spokesman said. However, he added that discussions with China about the plant were still at an early stage. It would have an annual capacity of up to 300,000 vehicles but would not be built until the 1990's at the earliest. VW already has a large joint venture with the Chinese authorities under which it produces the Santana model in Shanghai. The spokesman said the Shanghai plant should have an annual capacity of 30,000 cars by the end of next year. So far 15,000 Santanas have been produced since output began in 1985. The VW spokesman said no decision had yet been made about the type of car which could be built at the new plant. However, company officials have said VW plans to bring out a cheaper car than the Santana for the Chinese market and which will be aimed at private owners. The Santana is generally used by government officials and visiting foreigners or as taxis for tourists. No details were given about the extent of investment in the new plant and it was not clear where it would be built. Reuter \",\n",
